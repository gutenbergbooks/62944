<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>As the existence of the following tract was, until
quite recently, unknown,<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote A.">[A]</a> a few words of introduction,
exhibiting its character and the circumstances under
which it was written, may not be inappropriate.</p>

<p>The object of the work is, briefly to present to
the christian the evidences of personal piety and
guard these evidences from abuse and misapprehension.
It is divided into three parts. The author
first treats of the evidences of a piety, which, though
real, is weak and imperfect; secondly, the evidences
of a vigorous and maturer piety; and the third
part contains directions for maintaining and increasing
piety in the soul of the believer. It is written
with clearness and discrimination, and much resembles
the treatises of Baxter on the same subject. It is
as well adapted to the condition of christians of
the present day as to the condition of those for
whom it was written, two hundred and ten years
since. There cannot be found in it a word of
sectarian bitterness; on the contrary, it everywhere
breathes the spirit of catholic, christian charity.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which it was written
are certainly peculiar. It seems that his wife, to
whom he appears to have been tenderly attached,
had been dangerously ill, but was now recovering.
During her sickness he had been from home, laboring
among the Indians; and while absent, he wrote
this little treatise in the form of a letter to her,
his object being simply to promote her spiritual
improvement. At the request of his friends, it
was published in London; and a dedication was
prefixed to it, addressed to Lady Vane the Younger.
In this dedication, occurs the following remarkable
passage: "The form and stile I know will seem
to this refined age too rude and barbarous, and
the truth is, the most of it was penned and writ,
(so as seldom or never such discourses were,) in the
thickest of the naked Indians of America, in their very
wild houses, and by their barbarous fires, when the
Lord was pleased this last year (more than ordinarily)
to dispose my abode and travel among them."</p>

<p>As a writer, Roger Williams has generally borne the
reputation of a violent and bitter controversialist. I believe
that in this respect he has suffered great injustice.
It would seem from this tract, that, on the contrary,
his spirit was eminently candid and catholic,
and that controversy was to him a painful duty.
In the same dedication he says: "It is true, I
have been sometimes prest to engage in controversies,
but I can really and uprightly say, my witness
is on high, how harsh and dolefull the touch of
these strings are, [is,] and especially against such
worthies both in old and New England, in whom
I joyfully, before the world, acknowledge (in many
heavenly respects) a lively character and image of
the love of God." Every thing in this tract is in
harmony with such a declaration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stephen Randall</span>, Esq., a descendant of Roger
Williams, a gentleman who cherishes a proper respect
for the memory of his great ancestor, has been
at much pains to procure the use of one of the only
two known copies of this work, and at his instance it
is now re-published. It is nearly a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fac simile</i> of the
original copy, retaining, unchanged, all the obsolete
words and phrases, with all the peculiarities of orthography.
In this form it will be more interesting to the
public, and especially to antiquarians, than it could
be made by any change whatever. In the hope,
that, after the lapse of more than two centuries, it
will again be acceptable to christians of all denominations,
and exhibit in a new light the character
of a great and good man, it is now presented to
the descendants of the Puritans.</p>

    <h2 class="no-break">To the truly Honorable the
    Lady <em>Vane</em>, the Younger.</h2>
</div>

<p>Madam,</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Yo</span><i>ur favourable, and</i> Christian respects <i>to me</i>
(<i>both of former and latter date</i>) <i>your</i> Godly <i>and</i>
Christian Letters <i>to me, so many thousand miles
distant in</i> America: <i>And your many gracious</i>
Demonstrations <i>of an humble and</i> Christian
Spirit <i>breathing in you; are a three fold</i> Cord <i>which have
drawn these lines into your presence</i>.</p>

<p><i>While I have sometimes mused how to express a</i> Christian
gratitude, <i>I am at last perswaded to crave your</i> Ladyships
acceptance <i>of these poore</i> Experiments <i>of each true</i> Christians
personall union, <i>and</i> communion <i>with the</i> Father
<i>of</i> Spirits.</p>

<p><i>It is true, I have been sometimes prest to engage in</i> controversies,
<i>but I can really and uprightly say, my</i> Witnes
<i>is on</i> high, <i>how harsh and doleful the</i> touch <i>of those</i> strings
<i>are, especially, against such</i> Worthies <i>both in</i> old <i>and new</i>-England,
<i>in whom I joyfully before the world acknowledge</i>
(<i>in many heavenly respects</i>) <i>a lively character and</i> Image
<i>of the</i> Son <i>of God. This broken</i> piece, <i>is a breath of a</i>
still <i>and</i> gentle voice, <i>none but the</i> God <i>of this</i> world, <i>and
the</i> men <i>of this</i> world, <i>can I lightly</i> (<i>at this turne</i>) <i>expect
my</i> opposites.</p>

<p><i>At other times I have been drawne to consider of the little</i>
flock <i>of</i> Jesus, <i>his</i> Army, <i>his</i> body, <i>his</i> building,
<i>that for these many hundred years have been</i> scattered,
routed <i>and</i> laid wast <i>and</i> desolate: <i>At present, I onely
examine who are the</i> personall <i>and</i> particular Sheep of
Jesus Christ, <i>his</i> Souldiers, <i>his living</i> materials, <i>though</i>
scattered, divided, <i>and not</i> compos'd <i>and ordred at their
souls desire</i>.</p>

<p><i>I confess</i> (Madam) <i>it was but a</i> private <i>and</i> sudden
discourse, <i>sent in private to my poor</i> Companion <i>and</i>
Yoak-fellow, <i>occasioned by a sudden</i> sickness <i>threatening</i>
death, <i>into which, and from which it pleased the</i> Lord <i>most
graciously to cast and raise her</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> forme <i>and</i> stile <i>I know will seem to this refined</i> age,
<i>too rude and barbarous: And the</i> truth <i>is, the most of it
was penn'd and writ (so as seldom or never such discourses
were) in the thickest of the naked</i> Indians <i>of</i> America, <i>in
their very wild</i> houses, <i>and by their barbarous</i> fires; <i>when
the Lord was pleased this last year (more then ordinarily)
to dispose of my</i> abode <i>and</i> travell <i>amongst them. And yet,
is the</i> Language <i>plaine? it is the liker</i> Christs: <i>Is the
composure rude? such was his outward</i> Beauty: <i>Are the
tryals (seemingly) too close? such is the two edged</i> Sword <i>of
his most</i> holy Spirit, <i>which pierceth between the very</i> Soul
<i>and</i> Spirit, <i>and bringeth every</i> thought <i>into the</i> obedience
<i>of</i> Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><i>Amongst the many</i> Crowns <i>of</i> mercy (Madam) <i>which it
hath pleased the</i> Father <i>of mercies to crowne your</i> soul <i>with,
as</i> David <i>speaks of his</i>, Psal. 103. <i>there are two which
justly challenge (and your Ladyship I know doth humbly
acknowledge them) to be the fairest</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 Cor. 3.</div>

<p><i>The first, That he himselfe most</i> high, <i>most</i> holy, (<i>who
makes his common</i> choice, <i>the</i> poor, <i>Jam. 2. and chooseth few</i>
Lords, <i>few</i> Knights, <i>few</i> Ladies, (<i>few</i> wise, <i>few</i> noble,
<i>few</i> mighty) <i>hath freely chosen you</i> Madam, <i>in so gracious
and blessed a</i> measure, <i>to</i> desire <i>to</i> feare <i>his</i> Name.</p>

<p><i>A second, That for your dearest</i> Companion <i>and</i> Guide
<i>in this vale of</i> tears (<i>amongst the famous</i> Worthies <i>of this</i>
age) <i>he hath graciously guided you to such a blessed</i> choice, <i>of
such an</i> Husband <i>on</i> earth, <i>who beares so bright an</i> Image
<i>of your</i> Husband <i>in the</i> Heavens, <i>and in whose most
holy and gracious</i> hand, <i>he hath been such a</i> mercifull
<i>and</i> faithfull Instrument, <i>for both the</i> freedoms <i>both of
the</i> outward <i>and</i> inner <i>man</i>.</p>

<p><i>I doe humbly acknowledge (that upon an absolute account)
all is mercy, and yet I am also humbly confident, that in a</i>
respect (<i>as he graciously remembered his old friend</i> Abraham,
<i>and tels us of a speciall love he yet bears the</i> Jewes
<i>for</i> Abrahams <i>sake, even so, he hath graciously vouchsafed
at this present an</i> honorable remembrance <i>to the
NAMES of some of his more</i> eminent <i>former</i> friends <i>and</i>
witnesses.</p>

<p><i>How hath he crowned the</i> memory <i>of those his 2 zealous</i>
Servants <i>in K.</i> Henry <i>the 8th. his days<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote B.">[B]</a> with a most eminent
and blessed</i> succession <i>of such</i> names <i>and</i> spirits <i>at this
day? and in a gracious</i> remembrance <i>of his love to that
blessed</i> daughter <i>and</i> witnesse <i>of his the</i> Lady Vane <i>in Q.</i>
Maries <i>dayes; how hath it pleased his</i> wisedom <i>and</i> goodnesse,
<i>to remember and to honour that</i> Name, <i>both in your
Ladiship and so many otherways, with so many loving kindnesses
at this day</i>?</p>

<p><i>My humble cry</i> (Madam) <i>to the</i> Lord <i>shall never cease,
those all those your many</i> obligations <i>of both</i> temporall
<i>and</i> eternall mercies, <i>may</i> (<i>like chaines of</i> Adamant)
<i>draw and bind your precious</i> Soul <i>more and more to resolve
(by his grace assisting) to make his name</i> great, <i>who
hath made your so and so to love his</i> Name, <i>his</i> Son, <i>his</i>
Spirit, <i>his</i> Truth, <i>his</i> Children, <i>that others at the</i> Torch
<i>of your</i> exemplary meeknesse <i>and</i> fear <i>of</i> God, <i>may
light and kindle theirs; That your</i> Souls-eye <i>more and
more brightly may see him who is</i> invisible, <i>and may so experimentally
resent those</i> invisible <i>and</i> internal Honors,
pleasures <i>and</i> profits <i>that are in him that in comparison</i>
<i>thereof the</i> visible <i>and</i> worldly, <i>may be accounted by you but</i>
dreams <i>of</i> shadows, <i>&amp;c. That your</i> great desire <i>may be a</i>
likenesse <i>of so</i> high <i>and</i> holy, <i>and so dear a</i> Saviour, <i>and</i>
(<i>as in other</i> excellencies <i>so</i>) <i>in that especially of a desire</i> of
saving <i>others</i>, <i>your</i> Children, Kindred, Servants, Friends,
<i>yea</i>, Enemies: <i>that neither the pleasing</i> calme <i>of</i> prosperity,
<i>nor the dreadfull</i> storms <i>of</i> changes, <i>may quench or
dampe that holy</i> fire <i>of your souls</i> love (<i>in</i> Life <i>and</i>
Death) <i>to</i> Him <i>whom your</i> Ladyship <i>hath so much infinite
cause to love, but never yet saw, in whom, and for ever</i></p>

<p class="right">
<i>I desire to be</i></p>

    <h2 class="no-break">To every truly <em>Christian Reader</em>.</h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Thy Maker is
thy Husband.
Isa. 52.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">As</span> it is in the <em>Earthly</em>, so it is in the <em>Heavenly
Marriage</em> of a poor <em>Sinner</em> to his <em>Maker</em>. There
useth first to passe a <em>private</em> kindling of Love,
and a private <em>consent</em> and <em>promise</em> (which sometimes
are long) before the <em>open solemnity</em>, and the
<em>publike profession</em> of a Married Life together. This is
my present <em>designe</em>, (not to controvert the matters of
publike <em>Order</em> and <em>Worship</em>, but) to present some poor
Experiments of those Personall <em>excellencies</em> of each true
beleeving <em>soule</em> and <em>spirit</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isa. 40.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Prov. 21.</div>

<p>The Holy <em>Spirit</em> (in <cite>Isaiah</cite>) tels us of <em>Ballances</em> wherein
the most <em>High</em> weighs the <em>Hills</em> and <em>Mountains</em>: As
also in <em>Solomon</em>, of <em>Ballances</em> wherein hee weighs the very
<em>Spirits</em>, even of men whose way is right in their owne
eyes. And in <cite>John</cite> (14.) he commands us to try the
<em>Spirits</em>, pretending to come from <em>Christ Jesus</em>, whether
they be of <em>God</em>, or no.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great pretences
to the holy
Spirit of
God.</div>

<p>There is not the grossest <em>Protestant</em> or <em>Papist</em>, but pretends
to the <em>Spirit</em> of <em>God</em>; yea that horrid <em>Monster
Mahomet</em>, blusht not to avouch that in the <em>Forme</em> of a
<em>Dove</em>, the holy <em>Spirit</em> of <em>God</em> did whisper in his <em>eare</em> from
<em>Heaven</em>. Now blessed is that <em>Spirit</em>, <em>publike</em> or <em>private</em>,
who is truly willing and joyfull to lye downe in the <em>Ballances</em>
of the <em>Lords</em> weighings.</p>

<p>Hitherto tend these <em>Experiments</em> of personal Communion
with <em>God</em> in the <em>Spirit of Holinesse</em>, <cite>Rom.</cite> <i>1. 3</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To counterfeit
the holy
Spirit dreadfull.</div>

<p>'Tis true, all publike and private <em>Christian Spirits</em>,
pretend the <em>Spirit of Holinesse</em>: yea, how great a part of
the <em>World</em> pretend to be <em>Christendome</em>, the <em>Christian world</em>,
that is, anointed with the <em>Spirit</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>? But
was it <em>Death</em> in <em>Moses Rites</em> to counterfeit that ceremoniall
and figurative <em>Ointment</em>, <cite>Exod. 30</cite>. what shall it be
to counterfeit the <em>Spirit</em> of <em>Life</em> and <em>Holiness</em> it self?
What I beleeve therefore (as <em>David</em> and <em>Paul</em> once
spake) I freely speak: Yea, who can but speak (saith
<em>Peter</em> and <em>John</em>) the Things they have seene and heard?
I confesse I spake these first but in a private <cite class="no-italics"><i>Letter</i> in
<i>America</i></cite>, and thought not that the <em>light</em> in <em>Europe</em> should
have seen them: But a two-fold <em>desire</em> hath prevailed
with me to expose these <em>Tryalls</em> to the <em>Trying</em> of all men.</p>

<p class="indent">1. The earnest <em>desire</em> of some <em>Godly Friends</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">2. Mine owne <em>desire</em> of sowing a little handfull of
<em>spirituall seed</em> while the short <em>Minute</em> of my <em>seed-time</em> (the
<em>opportunity</em> of life) lasteth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The least of
the little ones
of Christ Jesus
ought to
rejoyce.</div>

<p>My scope is to fill each truly <em>Christian soule</em> with <em>triumphing</em>
and <em>rejoycing</em>: I speak <em>peace</em> and <em>joy</em> to the
Weakest <em>Lamb</em> and <em>Child</em> (in <em>Christianity</em>) that is so <em>low</em>,
so <em>weake</em>, so <em>litle</em>, so <em>poor</em> in its owne eyes, that it sometimes
saith, it hath no <em>Christ</em>, no <em>Spirit</em>, no <em>Faith</em>, no
<em>Love</em>, no nor true <em>Desire</em> in it selfe. To this poore
weake one I speak <em>peace</em> and <em>joy</em>, and say, this <em>spirituall
poverty</em> is blessed, and is the first <em>step</em> or <em>round</em> of that
spirituall <em>Ladder</em>, <cite class="no-italics">Mat. 5</cite>. Blessed are the poor in <em>spirit</em>,
for theirs is the <em>Kingdome</em> of <em>Heaven</em>.</p>

<p>Secondly, I found joyfull <em>Alarums</em> of <em>Encouragement</em>
to the <em>strong</em> to grow (as <em>Peter</em> exhorteth) in the <em>Grace</em>
and <em>Knowledge</em> of the <em>Lord Jesus</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Communion
of Saints most
sweet, and to
be lamented
after.</div>

<p>Tis true, the <em>communion</em> of <em>Saints</em> is <em>sweet</em> and joyfull,
<em>strong</em> and powerfull, eternally <em>gainfull</em> and profitable;
and holy and blessed is that <em>Spirit</em> that makes the <em>Saints</em>
(who are the <em>Excellent</em> of the Earth) its <em>Delight</em>, and after
that blessed hour of the <em>Saints uniting</em> in <em>one Heart</em>, <em>one
Spirit</em>, <em>one Worship</em>, let all that love <em>Christ Jesus</em> mourne
and lament, and breath and pant: And yet the weakest
and the faintest <em>Lamb</em> that comes but stealing in the Crowd
to touch the hemb of the <em>Lord Jesus</em> his garment, that
is content to be esteemed a <em>Dog</em>, and to wait for <em>crums</em>
of <em>mercy</em> under the <em>Table</em> of the Son of <em>God</em>: let them I
say rejoyce also, for he that hath begun that blessed work
by his owne free and eternall <em>Spirit</em>, will by the same
his owne holy <em>Arme</em>, gloriously finish it.</p>

<p>I end (<em>Deare Christian</em>) with the <em>proposall</em> of two
<em>Christian knots</em>, or <em>Riddles</em>, not unsuitable to these present
<em>Times</em> and <em>Spirits</em>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two Christian
Riddles,
suiting these
times and spirits.</div>

<p><em>First</em>, Why is the <em>Heart</em> of a <em>David</em> himself (<cite>Psa. 30.</cite>)
more apt to decline from <em>God</em>, upon the Mountaine of
<em>Joy</em>, <em>Deliverance</em>, <em>Victory</em>, <em>Prosperity</em>, then in the dark
<em>Vale</em> of the shadow of <em>Death</em>, <em>Persecution</em>, <em>Sicknesse</em>, <em>Adversity</em>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, Why is it, since <em>God</em> worketh freely in us to
<em>doe</em> and to <em>will</em> of his owne good pleasure, that yet he is
pleased to command us to <em>work</em> out our owne <em>Salvation</em>
with <em>Feare</em> and <em>Trembling</em>? Let us all humbly beg the
<em>Finger</em> (the Spirit) of the Lord to untie these <em>Knots</em>
for us.</p>

</div>

<p>
My <em>Dearest Love</em> and <em>Companion</em> in this <em>Vale of Tears</em>.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">The true use
of sicknesse.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Th</span>y late <em>sudden</em> and <em>dangerous Sicknesse</em>, and the
<em>Lords</em> most <em>gracious</em> and <em>speedy raising</em> thee up
from the <em>gates</em> and <em>jawes</em> of <em>Death</em>: as they were
wonderfull in thine <em>own</em>, and others <em>eyes</em>, so I
hope, and earnestly desire, they may be ever in
our <em>thoughts</em>, as a <em>warning</em> from <em>Heaven</em> to make ready
for a sudden <em>call</em> to be gone from hence: to live the
rest of our <em>short uncertaine span</em>, more as <em>strangers</em>, longing
and breathing after another <em>Home</em> and <em>Country</em>; To cast
off our <em>great cares</em> and <em>fears</em> and <em>desires</em> and <em>joyes</em> about
this <em>Candle</em> of this <em>vaine life</em>, that is so soon <em>blowne</em> out,
and to trust in the living <em>God</em>, of whose wonderfull power
and mercy thou hast had so much and so late <em>experience</em>,
which must make thee sing with <em>David</em> (<cite>Psal. <span class="no-italics">103</span></cite>.)
<em>Blesse the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me blesse
his holy Name: Blesse the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not
all his benefits, who forgiveth all thy sins, and healeth thine
infirmities: who redeemeth thy life from destruction, and
crowneth thee with mercy and loving kindnesse</em>.</p>

<p>My <em>dear Love</em>, since it pleaseth the <em>Lord</em> so to dispose
of me, and of my affairs at present, that I cannot often
see thee, I desire often to send to thee. I now send thee
that which I know will be sweeter to thee then the <em>Honey</em>
and the <em>Honey-combe</em>, and stronger refreshment then the
strongest <em>wines</em> or <em>waters</em>, and of more value then if
every line and letter were thousands of <em>gold</em> and <em>silver</em>.
<em>Hezekiah</em> upon his <em>recovery</em> from his <em>sicknesse</em>, made a
<em>writing</em> (<cite>Isai. <span class="no-italics">38</span></cite>.) as an <em>everlasting monument</em> of his <em>praise</em>
unto <em>God</em>, and as a <em>Goad</em> or <em>spur</em> to <em>himselfe</em> and <em>others</em> in
the <em>wayes of godlinesse</em> for the future.</p>

<p>Thy <em>holy</em> and <em>humble</em> desires are <em>strong</em>, but I know thy
<em>writing</em> is slow, and that thou wilt gladly accept of this
my <em>poore helpe</em>, which with <em>humble thankefulnesse</em> and <em>praise</em>
to the <em>Lord</em>, I humbly tender to his <em>holy service</em>, and
thine in him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The outward
and inner
man.</div>

<p>I send thee (though in <em>Winter</em>) an handfull of <em>flowers</em>
made up in a little <em>Posey</em>, for thy dear selfe, and our dear
children, to look and smell on, when <em>I as the grasse of
the field shall be gone, and withered</em>.</p>

<p>Wee know how it pleaseth the <em>spirit</em> of <em>God</em> to distinguish
between the <em>outward</em> and the <em>inner</em> man, <cite>2 Cor. <span class="no-italics">4</span></cite>.
[Though our <em>outward</em> man perish; yet our <em>inner</em> is renewed
day by day:] It hath pleased the most <em>high</em> to
cast downe thy <em>outward</em> man, and againe graciously to
lift him up, and thereby to teach us both, to examine
and try the <em>health</em>, and <em>strength</em>, and <em>welfare</em> of the <em>inner</em>.</p>

<p>I will not now enter upon the <em>Disputes</em> about that
<em>question</em>, what is the <em>Inner-man</em>, whether <em>Christ himselfe</em>,
as some say, or an <em>Image</em> or <em>likenesse</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, as
others say. That is a <em>Candle</em> or <em>Torch</em> to me, which is
written <cite>Ephes. 3</cite>. That <em>Christ</em> may dwell in your <em>Hearts</em>
by <em>faith</em>: unto which agrees that of the first of <cite>John</cite>:
As many as received him, that is received <em>Christ Jesus</em>
into the <em>house</em> of their <em>hearts</em> to dwell there by <em>believing</em>
and <em>obeying</em> of him, they are borne of the <em>Spirit</em>, and are
the <em>Sons</em> of <em>God</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the <em>inner-man</em>
is.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Subject to
many distempers.</div>

<p>This <em>Inner</em> man, this <em>new-man</em> (which after <em>God</em> is
created in <em>holinesse</em> and <em>righteousnesse</em>) I say, this <em>Inner-man</em>
hath his <em>tempers</em> and <em>distempers</em>, his <em>health</em> and <em>sicknesse</em>,
as well as this <em>outward-man</em> this <em>body</em> of <em>Clay</em>.</p>

<p>Hence we hear so often mentioned, the <em>renewing</em> of
the <em>inward-man</em>, the <em>growing</em> and <em>increasing</em> of <em>Faith</em> and
<em>Love</em>, and other <em>breathings</em> of <em>Gods Spirit</em>: the <em>losse</em> (that is
in a measure,) of the <em>Ephesians first love</em>. Hence the many
<em>falls</em> of the <em>Lords</em> best <em>Servants</em>, recorded in <em>Scripture</em>, and
the <em>sleep</em> of the <em>Spouse</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, although her <em>heart</em>
wake in the truth of <em>marriage-love</em>, which can never
wholly dye in her and be extinguished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A threefold
person in
<em>Gods</em> children</div>

<p>The holy <em>Scripture</em> mentioneth a <em>three-fold person</em> in
all that are borne againe, First, the body of <em>Flesh</em> and
<em>clay</em>, this <em>outward naturall being</em>, which must be dissolved
and dye, then rise againe to <em>Glory</em>.</p>

<p>The second is the body of <em>corruption</em>, or <em>old man</em>, which
being deadly wounded by the <em>Son</em> of <em>God</em> alreadie in all
that are his, shall shortly give up the <em>ghost</em>, and rot, and
never rise again.</p>

<p>The third is this holy, heavenly <em>inner</em> man, of whose
<em>health</em> and daily <em>renewing</em> I now discourse, who is born
of an immortall seed, and therefore can no more die then
<em>Christ</em> himself: <cite>Rom. 6</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A spirituall
cheerfull temper.</div>

<p>Now as this <em>outward man</em> desires not onely <em>life</em>, and
<em>being</em>, but also <em>health</em> and <em>cheerfulness</em> in all the living
<em>motions</em> and <em>actions</em> thereof: So, (and much more ten
thousand fold) requires the <em>inward</em> and <em>spirituall</em> man, an
<em>healthfull</em> and <em>cheerfull temper</em>. For as the Lord loveth
a <em>cheerfull giver</em>: So loves he also a cheerfull <em>Preacher</em>, a
chearfull <em>hearer</em>, a chearfull <em>prayer</em>, and a chearfull <em>sufferer</em>
for his Name sake: He loves that the shoes of
<em>preparation</em> be on our <em>feet</em> ready to run (all <em>wayes</em> and
<em>weathers</em>) the <em>paths</em> of his <em>Commandments</em>: That like a
<em>vessel</em> our <em>leaks</em> be stopt, and our whole <em>soul</em> be ready in
an holy <em>trim</em>, and <em>tightness</em>, for all his holy employments
of us in the greatest <em>tempests</em>: that like heavenly <em>souldiers</em>,
our <em>Arms</em> be fixt, or like an <em>Instrument</em>, the <em>strings</em> of our
<em>affections</em> and <em>parts</em> be all in tune, to make heavenly <em>musick</em>
in the holy <em>ears</em> of our heavenly <em>Lord</em> and <em>King</em>.</p>

<p>Tis true, as it is between a loving <em>couple</em>, (and as it
was in the Church at <em>Ephesus</em>) it is not easie to keep in
the first <em>flame</em> of <em>Love</em>, <em>fresh</em> and <em>equall</em>, although the <em>fire</em>
of the <em>truth</em> and <em>sinceritie</em> of <em>marriage love</em> never die, or
be extinguished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirituall distempers.</div>

<p>It is true that <em>Paul</em> cries out (how much more may
we) <em>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from
this body of death?</em></p>

<p>Tis true, that sometimes <em>corruption</em> and <em>Satan surprize</em>
and carry away the strongest <em>champions</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, as
<em>slaves</em> and <em>captives</em> for a time, untill <em>Christ Jesus</em> rescue,
redeem and ransome, by giving <em>repentance</em> unto his <em>Israel</em>,
as he did to <em>David</em>, <em>Peter</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> as <em>Abraham</em> rescued <em>Lot</em>,
and as <em>David</em> recovered all his precious <em>captives</em>, led <em>slaves</em>
away from <em>Ziklag</em>.</p>

<p>I am far therefore from passing the <em>sentence</em> of <em>death</em>
upon the least of the little ones of <em>Jesus</em>, (notwithstanding
their <em>spirituall weaknes</em>, and <em>sicknesses</em>) in whom the
least <em>spark</em> or breathing of the <em>spirit</em> of <em>Life</em> can be discerned.</p>

<p>And I desire to see and lament the <em>spirituall sicknesses</em>,
and <em>diseases</em> of mine own and others <em>Spirits</em>, which yet
are not unto <em>death</em> (as <em>Christ Jesus</em> spake of <em>Lazarus</em>) but
for the <em>glory</em> of <em>God</em>, in the <em>fall</em> and <em>rising</em> of his <em>servants</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction
between spirituall
<em>death</em>,
spirituall <em>sickness</em>
and spirituall
<em>weakness</em></div>

<p>Yea as <em>Paul</em> distinguisheth of <em>Gods</em> afflicting hand on
his <em>Saints</em> at <em>Corinth</em>, so must I distinguish, between these
three, <em>death</em>, <em>sicknes</em> and <em>weakness</em>: Every <em>sicknes</em> of <em>Gods
Children</em> is not a <em>death</em>, for the <em>inner</em> man cannot die, no
more then <em>Christ</em> himself. <cite>Rom: 6</cite>.</p>

<p>Again, every <em>weaknes</em> is not a <em>sicknes</em>, for some are
<em>weak</em>, little <em>ones</em> in the <em>knowledge</em> and <em>love</em> of <em>Christ</em>, while
others are grown to be <em>strong</em> and <em>aged</em> in <em>Christ Jesus</em>;
Yea, the <em>strongest</em> and oldest <em>Souldiers</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>,
who have not thought their dearest <em>Heartblood</em> to dear
for such a <em>Lord</em> and <em>Master</em>, have yet been troubled with
some <em>weaknes</em>, and fits of spirituall <em>distempers</em>: <em>Weaknes</em>
in their Eyes is not discerning aright the mind of <em>Christ
Jesus</em>, <em>weaknes</em> in their <em>hands</em>, and <em>Feet</em>, hindring their
spirituall <em>chearfulnes</em>, and <em>activity</em> in <em>Christs</em> wayes, which
weaknesses yet have not brought them to a down right
halting in <em>Christianity</em>.</p>

<p>I propose therefore (with the assistance of <em>Gods holy
spirit</em>) to examine these three particulars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Heads of
this Discourse</div>

<p>First, what are the <em>Arguments</em> of that measure of <em>spirituall
life</em> in <em>Christ</em>, which yet may stand with great <em>spirituall
weaknesses</em> and <em>diseases</em>.</p>

<p>2ly. What is the <em>measure</em> of the <em>grace</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>,
which may be called the <em>health</em>, and <em>chearfull temper</em>, and
disposition of the <em>inner</em> man.</p>

<p>3dly. What are those spiritual <em>preservatives</em>, which
may keep the <em>Soul</em> in an healthful <em>temper</em>, free from
spirituall <em>sicknesses</em> and <em>distempers</em>.</p>

<p>In these <em>Examinations</em> I professe two things: First not
to <em>oppresse</em> thy <em>thoughts</em> and <em>memory</em>, with any long <em>discourse</em>,
intending only to send thee after thy sicknes, a
little posey fit and easie for thy <em>meditation</em>, and <em>refreshing</em>.</p>

<p>2ly. All my <em>Flowers</em> shall be some choice <em>example</em>, or
<em>speech</em> of some <em>son</em> or <em>daughter</em> of <em>God</em>, pickt out from the
<em>Garden</em> of the holy <em>Scriptures</em> for our spiritually <em>refreshing</em>
and <em>consolation</em>.</p>

<p>I begin therefore with such <em>trialls</em> and <em>arguments</em> as
declare, the true life of the <em>inner man</em>, notwithstanding
spirituall <em>weaknes</em>, <em>sicknes</em>, and <em>distempers</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The weakest
of Gods children
cry unto
God as to a
Father.</div>

<p>First then when the <em>Spirit</em> of the <em>Lord</em> in <cite>1 Job. 2.</cite> describeth
the severall <em>Ages</em> and <em>grouths</em> of this inward <em>man</em>
(to wit a <em>child</em>, a <em>strong</em> man, and an <em>old man</em>) it pleasath him
to describe the young or little one by this <em>difference</em>, that
[He knows the <em>Father</em>] to wit, that he knows the <em>Lord</em>
so, as to look upon him (in his measure) as to a <em>Father</em>,
that he fears him, loves him, obeys him, and calls upon
him as on a <em>Father</em>: according to that of <cite>Gal: 4</cite>. Because
you are sons, he hath sent forth the spirit of his Son crying
in your Hearts <em>Abba Father</em>: <em>Father</em> pardon me,
<em>Father</em> help me, <em>Father</em> give me, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Obj.</i></div>

<p>But may not the <em>Hypocrites</em> call upon God, (and sometime
more boldly then <em>Gods little ones</em>,) <em>Lord Lord, Almighty</em>
and most mercifull <em>Father</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An.</i></div>

<p>I answer, an <em>Hypocrite</em> hath many <em>Lords</em>, and many
<em>Fathers</em>, besides, and joyned with their (pretended)
heavenly <em>Father</em>. Whereas <em>Gods little ones</em> cry out, (<cite>Isa.
63</cite>.) Doubtles thou art our <em>Father</em>, though <em>Abraham</em> be
ignorant of us, as if they had said: Thou art our only
<em>Father</em>, above all <em>Fathers</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">False calling
upon God as
upon a Father</div>

<p>2ly. The <em>Hypocrite</em> saies <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, but cares for no
more of the <em>will</em> of the <em>Lord</em> then may serve his own
<em>turne</em>: But a child of <em>God</em> declares his child like <em>submission</em>,
to an heavenly <em>Fathers</em> will in all things, according
to the difference proposed by the <em>Lord Jesus</em>, (<cite>Mat: 7</cite>.)
Not every one that saith unto me <em>Lord</em>, <em>Lord</em>, but he
that doth the wil of my <em>Father</em> which is in <em>Heaven</em>:
The difference lies not in the <em>words</em>, but in the <em>Heart</em>,
in the upright <em>submission</em> of a <em>child</em> of <em>God</em>, to all that he
believes to be the <em>will</em> and <em>pleasure</em> of his heavenly
<em>Father</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2 <i>Argum:</i>
Gods children
long for more
and more
knowledge of
God.</div>

<p>For a second <em>triall</em> therefore: Where <em>spirituall life is</em>
(notwithstanding <em>weaknes</em> or <em>distempers</em>) there is always a
professed <em>willingnesse</em> to get more and more <em>knowledg</em> of
this heavenly <em>Father</em>, of his <em>name</em>, of his <em>works</em>, of his
<em>word</em>, of his <em>Christ</em>, of his <em>Spirit</em>, his <em>Saints</em>, and <em>Ordinances</em>.</p>

<p>Hence <em>Beleevers</em> in <em>Jesus</em>, both <em>Men</em> and <em>Women</em>, are
called <em>Disciples</em>, or <em>Scholars</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, professing
continually to learn more and more of this heavenly
<em>teacher</em>. Hence his <em>Disciples</em> or <em>Scholars</em> petition to <em>Christ
Jesus</em>, <em>Lord</em> teach us to pray: <em>Lord</em> increase our <em>Faith</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Hence they ask him many <em>Questions</em>, and are by little
and little instructed, though for a while they were ignorant
of the mystery of his <em>Death</em>, and <em>Resurrection</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Obj.</i></div>

<p>But may not an <em>Hypocrite</em> desire to know more and
more of <em>God</em>, of <em>Christ</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ans.</i></div>

<p>I answer, although an <em>Hypocrite</em> out of an itching desire,
of <em>knowledg</em>, of <em>novelty</em>, and out of <em>self love</em>, to make
use of so much of <em>God</em>, and of <em>Christ</em>, as may serve his
own <em>ends</em>, may <em>desire</em>, and <em>attain</em>, and <em>professe</em>, and <em>preach</em>
much of <em>God</em> and <em>Christ</em>, yet will he pick and choose as
<em>Saul</em> did, while <em>David</em> and all <em>Gods children </em>uprightly
desire to have respect to all the <em>Commandements</em> of <em>God</em> in
<em>Christ Jesus</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2</div>

<p>Again, the <em>obedience</em> of <em>Hypocrites</em> is but the task of a
<em>slave</em>, or <em>Hireling</em>, when the obedience of a <em>child</em> of <em>God</em>,
is that of a dutifull <em>child</em> to his <em>Father</em>, or an endeared
<em>Wife</em> to her <em>Husband</em>, not caused by <em>terrour</em> or <em>wages</em>,
but hearty <em>Reverence</em> and <em>Affection</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Arg.</i> 3.
Gods children
hunger and
thirst after
Gods Word.</div>

<p>Hence follows a third <em>triall</em> of <em>spirituall life</em>, (though
accompanied with much <em>weaknes</em>,) to wit a vehement
<em>hunger</em> and <em>longing</em> after the <em>Ordinance</em> of the <em>word preached</em>:
Hence that <em>similitude</em> by <em>Peter</em>. As <em>New born Babes</em> desire
the sincere <em>milk</em> of the <em>word</em>, that you may grow
thereby, <cite>1. Pet: 2</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Obj.</i></div>

<p>But may not <em>Hypocrits</em> and <em>counterfeits</em>, both affectionately
hear and preach, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ans.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Gods word in
Gods way.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><cite class="no-italics">Cant 1</cite>.</div>

<p>I answer, no question, but <em>false worshippers</em>, and <em>false
Christians</em> may easily satisfie themselves, and stop the
mouths of their <em>consciences</em>, with any formal <em>performance</em>
of a <em>Sermon</em> by an <em>houre-glasse</em>, or other <em>traditions</em>, or <em>customes</em>
of <em>Fathers</em>, or the <em>times</em>. But a child of <em>God</em> desires
to be as well carefull (according to his <em>sight</em>, for the
true <em>Mothers-Breast</em>, (a true <em>Ministrie</em>) as for a Womans
Milk, the opening of the word by any in any way, <em>&amp;c.</em>
And therefore cries the <em>Spouse</em> to <em>Christ Jesus</em>: Oh thou
whom my <em>soul</em> loveth, shew me where thou <em>feedest</em>, for
why should I be as one that turns aside to the <em>flocks</em> of
thy <em>companions</em>.</p>

<p>2ly. A true <em>child</em> of <em>God</em> (though weak) looks chiefly
at <em>God</em>, and <em>Christ</em>, himself in the <em>Ministry</em>, and <em>dispensation</em>
of the <em>word</em>, and therefore saith (<cite>Cant:  1</cite>.) Let <em>Him</em>
kisse me with the <em>kisses</em> of his <em>mouth</em>, for his <em>love</em> is better
then <em>wine</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True hunger
after Gods
word.</div>

<p>3. While the <em>Hypocrites</em> find their natural <em>delight</em> in
the word, as in <em>musick</em>, while yet they obey not: The
child of <em>God</em> comes to the <em>breasts</em> of the <em>Church</em>, as a
child hangs upon the Mothers <em>Breast</em>, not only for the
<em>delight</em> of <em>sucking</em>, but out of a vehement painfull <em>longing</em>,
to have its <em>soul</em> satisfied, and its strength of <em>spirituall life</em>
and <em>grace</em> increased in the ways of <em>God</em>: according to that
in <cite>1. Pet. 2</cite>. [That you may grow thereby.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">True <em>desire</em> in
all Gods people.</div>

<p>A 4th. Argument of the <em>life</em> of the <em>inner man</em>, (though
in much <em>weaknes, or sicknes</em>, is a true and unfained <em>desire</em>,
to do that which it finds it cannot do, but falls short in
doing or suffering the <em>will</em> of <em>God</em>: So <em>Nehemiah</em> pleads
with <em>God</em>, from the <em>uprightnes</em> of their hearts, that they
desired to fear his <em>Name</em>, when a <em>soul</em> can say uprightly
in <em>Gods</em> presence, I desire, that is, unfainedly longing to
know his will, although I am much <em>ignorant</em>, I desire to
<em>believe</em>, though I find an <em>unbelieving heart</em>, I desire to be
<em>willing</em> and <em>able</em> to <em>suffer</em>, though I find much <em>fearfulnesse</em>,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Ob.</i> May not an <em>Hypocrite</em> desire to <em>know</em> and love
<em>God</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difference
between the
true and false
desire.</div>

<div class="sidenote">God must be
chosen for
himself.</div>

<p>I answer, an <em>Hypocrite</em> may desire to know so much of
<em>God</em>, and to have so much of his <em>grace</em>, and so much of
his <em>power</em> against some sins, as may serve to save his <em>soul</em>,
when he sees he cannot be <em>saved</em> without it: But a <em>child</em>
of <em>God</em>, only can desire <em>God</em> for <em>himself</em>, and desire to be
like unto <em>God</em> in his holy <em>Nature</em>, and to have every
<em>thought</em> brought under the <em>obedience</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>.</p>

<p>Hence though an <em>Hypocrite</em> may weep as <em>Esau</em> and
<em>Saul</em>, and others have done, yet a true <em>child</em> of <em>God</em> can
only in truth cry out, with the <em>Father</em>, of the possessed
<em>child</em> in an humble sence of his own <em>weaknes</em>, and <em>spirituall
poverty</em>, <em>Lord I believe</em>, help thou my <em>unbelief</em>, that is,
help me against my <em>unbelief</em>, against my <em>passions</em>, against
my <em>uncleanesse</em>, against my <em>pride</em>, against my <em>covetousnes</em>,
&amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
cannot live in
known sin
without strugling
&amp; mourning.</div>

<p>A 5th: <em>triall</em> of a true <em>life</em> (though in <em>weaknes</em>, or <em>sicknes</em>)
is a constant <em>resisting</em> and <em>fighting</em> against all known
<em>sin</em>, as <em>sin</em>. He that is born of <em>God</em>, (<cite>1. John 5</cite>.) keepeth
himself that the <em>evill</em> one toucheth him not, unles he be
suddenly <em>surprised</em>, or violently <em>forced</em>, by mighty <em>temptations</em>,
or <em>cousoned</em> and <em>deceived</em> by the <em>deceitfulnesse</em> of <em>sin</em>,
he can no more willingly touch it, then <em>fire</em> or <em>poison</em>, or
the <em>Devill</em> himself.</p>

<p>Hence is there a continuall war between the <em>flesh</em> and
the <em>Spirit</em>, <cite>Gal: 5</cite>. The <em>law</em> of the <em>mind</em>, wars against the
<em>law</em> of the <em>members</em>; The <em>New-man</em> against the <em>old</em>, &amp;c.
For instance, although good <em>Jacob</em> was overcome by his
<em>Mothers</em> powerful <em>perswasion</em>, yet suspecting a <em>sin</em> he
first strugled against it, my <em>Father</em> saith he, will feel me,
and I shall bring a <em>curse</em> instead of a <em>Blessing</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Obj.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">No hypocrite
can fight against
sin as
sin.</div>

<p>But may not an <em>Hypocrite</em> resist <em>temptation</em>, and fight
against <em>sin</em>? I answer, No, not against <em>sin</em> as <em>sin</em>, but as it
is dangerous and hurtful to <em>soul</em>, to <em>body</em>, to <em>purse</em>, to
<em>credit</em>. So <em>Balaam</em> (I conceive in earnest) refused <em>Balacks</em>
mony, and would not <em>sin</em> for an house full of <em>gold</em> and
<em>silver</em>, when as yet he loved that <em>sin</em> of cursing <em>Gods</em> people,
and the <em>wages</em> of it.</p>

<p>2ly. An <em>Hypocrite</em> cannot resist the sin of <em>Hypocrisie</em>,
and other <em>darling sins</em>: but a child of <em>God</em> with <em>David</em>
(<cite>Psal: 139</cite>.) begs of <em>God</em> to search him, that is to help
him against <em>Hypocrisie</em> it self, and every false way, and to
lead him in the <em>way everlasting</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A true childe
of God tender
of Gods name.</div>

<p>Sixtly, a <em>child</em> of <em>God</em> though overwhelmed with many
<em>weaknesses</em> or <em>temptations</em>, yet he cannot possibly be
brought to an ill <em>opinion</em> or <em>thought</em> of <em>God</em>, but is always
ready to take his <em>part</em>, to <em>speak</em> well of him, and endures
not, with a quiet mind, to hear his name dishonored:
Hence <em>Job</em> in his great <em>passions</em> and <em>cursings</em>, could not be
brought (no not by his <em>wife</em>) to speak ill of <em>God</em>: but
although he complained much of his own <em>affliction</em>, and
stood to his <em>uprightness</em>, against the <em>charge</em> of <em>Hypocrisie</em>,
yet still he magnifies the name of his <em>God</em> in all his <em>discourses</em>,
and professeth to trust in him, although his <em>God</em>
should kill him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Instances of
<em>Samson</em> and
<em>Jehosaphat</em>.</div>

<p>Hence <em>Samson</em>, though carried away first by a <em>Philistian
wife</em>, and then by a <em>Philistian whore</em>, yet can he not be
carried away so from the <em>God</em> of Israel, but that still he
acknowledgeth his <em>high</em> and <em>holy hand</em> in his <em>victories</em> and
<em>deliverances</em>, and accordingly poures forth his <em>soul</em> to him
for <em>grace</em> and <em>assistance</em>. And hence good <em>Jehosaphat</em>
though very strongly carried away with the flatterie of
the <em>idolatrous King</em> of <em>Israel</em>, yet he endures not to hear
the name of his <em>God</em> smitten through the sides of his
<em>servant</em> the Prophet <em>Micaiah</em>, but plainly (though weakly)
takes part with his <em>God</em> and his <em>Prophet</em>, against the
<em>King</em> of <em>Israel</em>, and all his <em>Priests</em> and <em>Courtiers</em>, saying,
<em>Let not the King say so</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> May not <em>Balaam</em> and other <em>hypocrites</em> pretend
the <em>name</em> of <em>God</em> and <em>Christ</em>, be <em>preachers</em> of him, call out
<em>devils</em>, and in <em>Christs name</em> do many <em>wonderfull</em> things?</p>

<p>I answer: <em>Hypocrites</em> use the name of <em>God</em> onely as
<em>Jehu</em> did, for a <em>stirrup</em> to get up into the <em>sadle</em> of their
own <em>Names</em> and <em>Honours</em>, or as a <em>commodity</em> to get something
by it, as an <em>hireling</em> (of whom the <em>Lord Jesus</em> speaks
<cite class="no-italics">John 10</cite>.) that serves <em>God</em> for <em>wages</em>, and while he cries,
let the <em>Lord</em> be glorified, (<cite>Isa. 66</cite>.) he <em>persecutes</em> his
servants, but a child of <em>God</em> cannot be brought except
by surprisall for a time, to prefer his <em>name</em> before <em>Gods</em>,
but upon <em>cool thoughts</em>, is seriously willing to be trodden
in the dust, and to be cast out, that the <em>name</em> of <em>God</em>
alone may be exalted, and glorified, as <em>David</em> after the
causing of the name of <em>God</em> to be blasphemed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A true childe
of God is patient
under
the rod of his
Heavenly Father.</div>

<p>A 7th. Argument of the true <em>life</em> of <em>grace</em> (though in
much <em>weaknes</em> or <em>sicknes</em>,) I observe to be an humble
<em>acknowledgment</em> of, and a <em>submitting</em> unto the <em>correcting</em> and
<em>afflicting</em> hand of <em>God</em>, in <em>sicknesses</em>, <em>crosses</em>, <em>losses</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This admirably appears in old <em>Ely</em>, who though he
were a bad <em>Father</em> to his own sons, in suffering them
<em>unpunished</em> (though not <em>unreproved</em>) in their outragious
<em>transgressions</em>: Yet was he at the same time a good son
to <em>God</em>, his heavenly <em>Father</em>, in giving that heavenly <em>and</em>
submissive <em>answer</em> to that fearfull <em>threatening</em> sent from
the <em>Lord</em> by <em>Samuel</em> against him, saying, It is the <em>Lord</em>,
let him do what seemeth him good.</p>

<p><em>Ob:</em> But did not <em>Pharaoh</em> acknowledg, and the <em>Philistines</em>
acknowledg <em>Gods</em> hand in smiting them, did not
<em>Ahab</em> humble himself, <em>Pharaoh</em> sues unto <em>God</em> by <em>Moses</em>,
the <em>Philistins</em> send a trespasse <em>offering</em>, and <em>Ahab</em> humbles
himself by fasting, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">1.
The enemies
of God, and
flatterers cannot
submit to
God as to a
Father.</div>

<p>I answer, a <em>Saul</em>, a <em>Pharaoh</em>, &amp;c. if it were in their
choice, would not submit to the <em>Lord</em> at all, and when
they do acknowledge and submit, they are forced to it,
by <em>Gods</em> powerfull hand, whom yet they look at as a
conqueror of <em>Julian</em> said of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, and <em>Jaolor</em> or
<em>executioner</em>, not as a <em>Father</em>, with a child like <em>submission</em>,
as appears by <em>Pharaoh</em>, the <em>Philistines</em>, <em>Ahab</em>, and many
more wofull <em>instances</em>, when the <em>hand</em> of <em>God</em> is removed,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Whereas a true <em>child</em> of <em>God</em> desires, as to acknowledge
his <em>Fathers</em> hand correcting his <em>righteously</em>, because he
hath deserved it, so also <em>graciously</em> and <em>faithfully</em>, because
he hopes <em>God</em> aims at his good, as a <em>Father</em> doth at a
<em>childs</em>, in giving him fatherly <em>correction</em>, bitter <em>Pills</em> and
<em>Phisick</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
less grieve for
their own affliction,
then
for Gods displeasure.</div>

<p>And therefore (2ly:) as when the <em>Lord</em> strikes an
<em>Hypocrite</em>, he either <em>runs</em> from him as a <em>strange child</em> stricken
by another man, or <em>flies against</em> him in <em>murmuring</em>, or
<em>howls</em> out for anguish as a <em>Dog</em>, (<cite>Hos: 7</cite>.) They howl
upon their Beds: So contrarily the true <em>child</em> of <em>God</em>
truly desires to run to his heavenly <em>Father</em>, and it as
well, yea infinitely more <em>grieved</em>, for the <em>anger</em>, and <em>displeasure</em>
of the <em>Lord</em>, as for his own <em>smart</em> and <em>affliction</em>.</p>

<p>3ly. The <em>Hypocrite</em> if he might have his own choice,
had rather be rid of his <em>pain</em> than his <em>sin</em>, and therefore
when his <em>pain</em> is over, he returns with the <em>Dog</em> to his
Vomit: But a true <em>child</em> of <em>God</em>, truly (though weakly)
desires to <em>see</em>, and <em>abhor</em>, and slay his <em>dearest sins</em>, because
he knows they are but flattering <em>traytors</em> and <em>guilded poysons</em>:
Hence <em>Job</em> cries out in the midst of all his <em>weaknesses</em>
and <em>passions</em>, Oh teach me wherein I have offended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
joyn with
Gods rod against
themselves.</div>

<p>In a word, the <em>Lord</em> is fain to force <em>affliction</em> upon an
<em>Hypocrite</em>, as men force down a <em>drench</em> into the throat of
an <em>Horse</em>, but a true <em>child</em> of <em>God</em>, (if under <em>Gods rod</em>,)
desires to joyn with the <em>Lords hand</em>, and the <em>Lords ends</em>,
as a child of some understanding is willing to have its
<em>wormes</em> killed, and therefore strives (<em>willingly</em>, <em>unwillingly</em>)
to swallow down the bitter <em>aloes</em>, or other bitter <em>medicine</em>.</p>

<p>An 8th: Triall of true <em>life</em>, (though in <em>weaknes</em>) is a
<em>true</em> (though <em>faint</em>) <em>willingnes</em> and inclination to enjoy
more and more of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, in the <em>society</em> of his <em>Saints</em>,
after his own <em>appointment</em>, although with <em>hardship</em> and
<em>difficulty</em> attained unto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods people
long after
Gods true
worship in
Christ Jesus.</div>

<p>Hence the <em>Spouse</em> was both <em>asleep</em>, and <em>awake</em>, toward
<em>Christ Jesus</em>: <cite>Cant: 5</cite>. She was <em>willing</em>, and <em>unwilling</em> to
rise to <em>open</em> to <em>Christ Jesus</em>: Hence she thinks she hears
her <em>Husbands voice</em>: It is the <em>voice</em> of my <em>Beloved</em>: She
thinks <em>Christ</em> is knocking at the <em>door</em> of her <em>heart</em>, and
<em>will</em>, in such and such <em>arguments</em>, in such and such <em>Scriptures</em>,
in such and such <em>professions</em>, and <em>professours</em>, in such
and such their <em>suffrings</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> May it not possibly be that the true <em>children</em> of <em>God</em>,
not only may neglect, but even deny the <em>Ordinances</em> of
<em>Christ Jesus</em>, appointed and practised in his first <em>Churches</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods people
both awake &amp;
asleep as to
Christ Jesus.</div>

<p>I answer, <em>Gods Israel</em> and <em>people</em> under the <em>Gospel</em>, may
as possibly be spirituall <em>slaves</em> and <em>captives</em> to <em>Egypt</em> and
<em>Babylon spirituall</em>, as <em>Israel</em> of old was to <em>Babell</em>, <em>literall</em>
and <em>materiall</em>, in respect of the <em>worshipping</em> of <em>God</em>, according
to the <em>appointment</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>.</p>

<p>In respect of false <em>worship</em>, <em>Gods Israel</em> may be a <em>slave</em>,
and <em>asleep</em>, and yet <em>awake</em>, and <em>free</em>, in true <em>inclinations</em>
and <em>desires</em>, <em>willing</em> (though mixt with <em>sleepy unwillingnes</em>)
to be at any pains and cost, to enjoy her <em>souls beloved
Christ Jesus</em>, in his own appointments.</p>

<p>Hence such <em>expressions</em> with <em>sighs</em> and <em>tears</em>, if I were
perswaded of <em>Gods will</em>, if I were perswaded of the <em>necessity</em>
of such public <em>ordinances</em> and <em>formes</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods people
cannot but be

<p>Hence others <em>expressions</em>, if I were perswaded of <em>such</em>
and <em>such ordinances</em>, that <em>such</em> a people, or <em>such</em> a people
were in the true way of enjoying <em>Christ Jesus</em>, how <em>joyfully</em>
should I joyn with them?</p>

<p>Hence holy <em>David</em>, though not so thoroughly awaked,
to enjoy the <em>Ark</em> and <em>presence</em> of <em>God</em>, he and all
<em>Israel</em> brings up the <em>Ark</em> of <em>God</em> with <em>rejoycing</em>, though
not after the <em>Lords</em> due <em>order</em>, which caused his holy

amongst them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True marriage

<p>It is in the <em>heavenly</em> as in the <em>earthly marriage</em>, there
are degrees of <em>marriage affection</em>, and yet all true: The
<em>affections</em> of some are more <em>lively</em> and <em>strong</em>, of some more
<em>dull</em> and <em>weak</em>: When yet the <em>truth</em> and <em>life</em> appears in
a true and longing desire to enjoy the <em>Lord Jesus</em>, in
what way soever, himself is pleased to appoint, and to
turn from the <em>bed</em> and <em>bozome</em>, (that is the <em>worships</em>) of
all <em>false Christs</em>, and <em>strangers</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
have no peace
in sin unrepented
of.</div>

<p>A 9th. discovery of true <em>spirituall life</em>, in <em>weaknes</em>, I
find to be a <em>painfull</em> and a <em>restles</em> mind, in <em>temptations</em> to
<em>sin</em>, in <em>yeelding</em> to <em>sin</em>, and <em>lying</em> in <em>sin</em>, the <em>breach</em> not being
made up with the <em>Lord</em> in humble <em>confession</em> and <em>suit</em> for
<em>mercy</em>, in the blood of a <em>Saviour</em>. This was <em>Davids</em> painfull
<em>case</em> in his <em>silence</em>, <cite class="no-italics">Psal. 32</cite>. When I kept silence my
<em>bones</em> waxed old, through my <em>roaring</em> all the <em>Day</em>.</p>

<p>So that as a <em>Fish</em> out of the <em>water</em> (its element) as a
<em>bone</em> broak or disjoynted, is the <em>troubled mind</em> of a child
of <em>God</em>, upon his <em>discovered</em> or but (strongly) <em>suspected</em>,
sinfull <em>way</em> or <em>practice</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> May not <em>Hypocrites</em> be troubled in the sence of
<em>Gods displeasure</em> for <em>sin</em>, as <em>Saul</em>, <em>Ahab</em>, and <em>Judas</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Only <em>Gods</em>
people can
truly desire

<p>I answer, an <em>Hypocrite</em> like some <em>Traytor</em> or <em>murtherer</em>,
may desire a pardon from the <em>King</em> of <em>Kings</em>, whose person
he hates, so did <em>Saul</em> and <em>Ahab</em>, and so may any dissembler
for his own ends of <em>peace</em> and <em>safety</em>, &amp;c. But
<em>Gods children</em>, and they only grieve at <em>Gods displeasure</em> and
grievance. Only a true <em>Wife</em> and <em>Spouse</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>
can grieve and mourn for the displeased <em>absence</em> of <em>Christ

him whom my soul loveth?</p>

<div class="sidenote break-before">Two sorts of
Gods people
enquiring &amp;
longing after
Christ Jesus.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The liking of
<em>Gods</em> gracious
<em>Spirit</em> in others,
a true
<em>Argument</em> of
the same <em>Spirit</em>
in ourselves.</div>

<p>A 10th. triall of the true <em>life</em> of the <em>inner</em> man, (though
<em>weak</em> and <em>sickly</em>,) is a <em>discerning</em>, and <em>liking</em>, and secret
<em>wishing</em> that <em>beauty</em> and <em>shining</em> of the <em>grace</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>,
which appears in others of <em>Gods Children</em>, and which we
see wanting in our <em>selves</em>. Thus were there a sort of
<em>Gods children</em>, which could see <em>beauty</em> and <em>excellency</em> in
those which so affectionately inquired after <em>Christ Jesus</em>,
in his visible worship, and the severall parts thereof, although
themselves were not so zealously affected. Thus
therefore say they: O thou the <em>fairest</em> of <em>Women</em>, (an
<em>acknowledgment</em> of heavenly <em>grace</em> and <em>beauty</em>, and they
also enquire, and desire to see that <em>beauty</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>,
which the other <em>Saints</em> so praised. And in <cite>Cant: 6</cite>. they
say, whither is thy <em>Beloved</em> gone, oh thou <em>fairest</em> among
<em>Women</em>, that we may seek him with thee: Hence many
of <em>Gods</em> dear <em>Saints</em> in <em>Qu: Maries</em> time, and other bloody
days, in our own and other <em>countries</em>, have praised <em>God</em>
for, and have been ravished with the <em>beauties</em> of the
heavenly <em>love</em> and <em>zeal</em>, and <em>patience</em> in others of <em>Gods
servants</em>, which they have seen wanting in themselves:
And thus, (whatever be our <em>weaknesses</em>) it must needs
argue a <em>life</em> of <em>grace</em>, when we can view the <em>lives</em> and
<em>deaths</em> of the blessed <em>martyrs</em>, or <em>witnesses of Christ Jesus</em>,
(either in the holy <em>scriptures</em>, or other <em>Records</em>, I say can
view them with a <em>liking</em> and true <em>affecting</em> of their <em>graces</em>,
with an humble acknowledgment of our own <em>wants</em> and
<em>poverties</em>, and a mourning <em>desire</em> of <em>attaining</em> to such a
beauteous <em>profession</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>.</p>

<p>Such a <em>beauty</em> (doubtles) did many of <em>Gods children</em>
apprehend in the <em>Lords Ordinances</em>, and in such as suffred
for them in <em>England</em>, who yet found not strength
themselves, to stand and suffer for, and with them, yet
left much and fled to <em>New England</em>, hoping to enjoy
there (though with too much weak desire of <em>peace</em> and
<em>liberty</em>) the <em>Ordinances</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, their <em>souls Beloved</em>.</p>

<p><em>Obj.</em> But did not <em>Balaam</em> see the <em>beauty</em> and <em>excellency</em>
of <em>Gods Saints</em>, when he cried out, let me dye the <em>death</em>
of the <em>righteous</em>, and let my last end be like his, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>I answer, it is usually well said, <em>Balaam</em> desired the
<em>death</em>, and <em>blessednes</em> of the <em>righteous</em>, but not the <em>life</em> and
<em>righteousnesse</em> of the <em>righteous</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> <em>Balaam</em> seems to have seen the <em>beauty</em> of <em>righteousnesse</em>
it self.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Dissemblers</em>,
in a respect
may desire
<em>righteousness</em>,
but only <em>Gods
children</em> can
long for it in
truth, and for
it self.</div>

<p>I answer, he might see and like <em>righteousnes</em> in the <em>end</em>,
and <em>fruit</em> of it, and yet not in the true <em>nature</em> and <em>beauty</em>
of it, for then he would have as well desired the <em>life</em>, as
the <em>death</em> of the <em>righteous</em>, just as these <em>Indians</em> (amongst
whom I write these lines) they see the <em>excellency</em> of the
<em>English industry</em>, joyned with <em>plenty</em>, and a better <em>condition</em>
then their own, but endure not that <em>life</em> of <em>labour</em> and
<em>indeavour</em>, wherein that <em>plenty</em> and better <em>state</em> is found.
But <em>Gods children</em> beholding the <em>beauty</em> and <em>excellency</em> of
the heavenly <em>lives</em> and <em>deaths</em> of others, (like <em>souldiers</em> in
a Field) are provoked by those <em>examples</em>, to desire to
follow <em>Christ Jesus</em> in those holy <em>paths</em>, and secretly to
bemoan their own <em>infirmities</em> and <em>deformities</em>.</p>

<p>These and many more <em>discoveries</em> of the <em>life</em> of <em>Christ
Jesus</em> in the <em>soul</em>, (though in the midst of many <em>weaknesses</em>,
and spirituall <em>sicknesses</em>) I hope (my <em>dear love</em> and
faithfull <em>companion</em>) thou in truth discernest in thy <em>self</em>,
and I, and others have discerned in thee: But oh search
diligently in the <em>Lords</em> holy <em>presence</em>, and humbly beg
his help, that as the <em>Spirit</em> of <em>God</em> admonisheth, (<cite>Gal. 6</cite>.)
thou maiest have rejoycing in thy <em>self</em>, and not in anothers
good opinion of thee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
cannot but
desire spirituall
health, as
wel as life
and Christian
being.</div>

<p>But grant all these, and the <em>assurance</em> of a true and
blessed <em>life</em> of <em>grace</em> within us?</p>

<p>Grant this <em>life</em> is as the <em>life</em> of <em>Christ</em>, never again to
be extinguished. Yet who rejoyceth not in <em>health</em>, who
mourns not under the <em>pains</em> and <em>weaknesses</em> of a sick bed?</p>

<p>Next therefore to the <em>discovery</em> of <em>spirituall life</em>, all that
are born of <em>God</em> must try their <em>spirituall strength</em>, and
<em>health</em>, and <em>chearfull temper</em>: The particular <em>instances</em>
whereof, being propounded as <em>examples</em>, <em>copies</em>, and <em>samplars</em>
for us to follow in the holy <em>Scripture</em>, I shall pick,
and gather, and bind up, for both our <em>incouragement</em>, and
comfort.</p>

<p>I confesse the beholding of such <em>heavenly patterns</em> may
astonish and amaze us, and make us dispair to attain to
the like heavenly <em>temper</em>: I pray thee therefore (<em>dear
love</em>) observe, (what before I said) that these <em>particulars</em>
next following are not <em>discouragements</em> from <em>Christ</em>, as if
we had no <em>life</em> at all: but <em>incouragements</em> to draw neerer
to <em>Christ Jesus</em>, when we see such <em>virtue</em> proceed out from
him, to such poor <em>sinners</em> like our selves.</p>

<p>These <em>particulars</em> then following are as an holy <em>looking-glasse</em>,
to discover to us our souls <em>spots</em>, &amp; <em>blemishes</em>, as
also sweet <em>cordial flowers</em>, to refresh and incourage our
<em>drooping spirits</em>.</p>

<p>The severall particular <em>trialls</em> of this <em>spirituall health</em>,
and <em>chearfulnesse</em>, I shall bind up (as I may so speak)
into three severall <em>parcells</em>, as sometimes we see sweet
<em>flowers</em> bound up into smaller <em>bundles</em>, to make up at last
one larger <em>bundle</em> or <em>posie</em> in one.</p>

<p>The three severall sorts shall be according to that <em>division</em>
of the <em>holy Spirit</em> by <em>Paul</em> to <em>Titus</em>.</p>

<div class="indent">
<p>First such as concern <em>holines</em>, respecting our <em>communion</em>
with <em>God</em> in <em>Christ Jesus</em>.</p>

<p>2. Such as concern <em>righteousnesse</em>, respecting others.</p>

<p>3. Such as concern <em>sobriety</em>, respecting our private
<em>selves</em> and <em>persons</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Incomprehensible
nature of
God.</div>

<p>First, then it is an <em>argument</em> of the <em>strength</em>, and <em>healthful
temper</em> of the <em>inner</em> man, when our <em>apprehensions</em> of
<em>God</em> are always such, as bring us to holy <em>wonderment</em> and
<em>amazement</em>, at the <em>nature</em> of incomprehensible <em>God</em>, at his
<em>properties</em>, and <em>works</em>, from the <em>Sun</em> in the <em>Firmament</em>, to
the poorest <em>Worme</em>, at his wonderfull <em>dispensing</em> of his
<em>justice</em>, and <em>mercy</em>, and <em>disposing</em>, and <em>ruling</em> all things in
<em>Heaven</em>, <em>Earth</em>, and <em>Seas</em>, from the highest <em>Angels</em> in <em>heaven</em>,
to the lowest <em>Devils</em> in <em>Hell</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
ought to walk
in constant
amazedness
of spirit as to
God his nature,

&amp;c.</div>

<p>This was <em>Davids temper</em> when he cried out, (<cite>Psal: 104</cite>.)
Oh Lord how <em>wonderfull</em> are thy <em>works</em>, in <em>wisedome</em> hast
thou made them all! Also (<cite>Psal. 8.</cite>) O <em>Jehovah</em> our
Lord, how <em>wonderfull</em> is thy <em>Name</em> in all the <em>earth</em>! And
<cite>Psal: 139</cite>. he brings this wonder nearer to <em>himself</em>, saying,
I will praise thee, for I am <em>fearfully</em> and <em>wonderfully</em> made.
As if he would say, <em>fearfully</em> and <em>wonderfully bred</em> in the
<em>womb</em>, <em>fearfully</em> and <em>wonderfully</em> brought forth; and we
may further say, ever since we came thus <em>fearfully</em> and
<em>wonderfully</em> into the <em>world</em>, <em>fearfully</em> and <em>wonderfully
brought</em> up, <em>fearfully</em> and <em>wonderfully preserved</em>, <em>delivered</em>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But may not <em>naturall</em> men, and <em>Hypocrites</em> admire
the <em>Nature</em>, and <em>works</em> of <em>God</em>.</p>

<p>I answer, yes, but the <em>wonder</em> which doth possesse a
<em>child</em> of <em>God</em>, causeth him to cry out with <em>David</em>, <cite>Psal.
119</cite>. Thy <em>hands</em> have made me, and fashioned me, give
me understanding that I may learn thy <em>statutes</em>. Tis
such a wonder as <em>draweth</em> up the <em>heart</em> unto <em>God</em>, with
<em>longings</em> to be <em>united</em> unto him, to fear his <em>Name</em>, to partake
of his divine <em>Nature</em>, and to be like unto <em>Him</em> in
<em>holines</em>, and <em>true Righteousnes</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> The <em>Devills</em> believe, and tremble at <em>God</em>.</p>

<p>I answer, to tremble at the <em>word</em> of <em>God</em>, is alone the
<em>property</em> of <em>Gods Servants</em>, Isa. 66 The <em>Devills</em> may wonder
and tremble at the just sentence, and threatening
part of <em>Gods word</em>: But <em>Gods children</em> tremble at the
<em>commanding</em> part, yea at the <em>comforting</em> and <em>promising</em> part
of it also, least they should depart or fall off from it, or
loose, though but for a time as <em>David</em>, the joy and sweetnes
of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The glorifying
of God the
great work of
Gods children</div>

<p>Secondly, it is an <em>Argument</em> of <em>health</em> and spirituall
<em>strength</em>, when the <em>hallowing</em>, the <em>magnifying</em>, and <em>glorifying</em>
of the <em>name</em> of <em>God</em> is our great <em>work</em> and <em>business</em> in
this <em>world</em>, unto which all the <em>businesses</em> and <em>works</em> we
have in hand in the world beside give way, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Thus <em>Christ Jesus</em> teacheth all his to make it their <em>first
request</em> to <em>God</em>, that they may <em>hallow</em>, or <em>glorifie</em> his <em>name</em>:
Thus he professeth (as it were upon his <em>death bed</em>) <em>John</em>
17. that he had done his <em>work</em>, that he had <em>glorified</em> his
<em>Father</em> upon the <em>earth</em>: Hence he professeth at his most
solemn <em>Arraignment</em>, <cite>Job 18</cite>. for this <em>end</em> was I born, and
for this <em>end</em> came I into the <em>world</em>, that I might bear <em>witness</em>
to the <em>truth</em>; that is, to give his <em>Father</em> the <em>glory</em> of
his <em>truth</em>, and to destroy the <em>lyes</em> of the <em>devill</em> the <em>father</em>
of them, who belyeth <em>God</em> in all his holy <em>attributes</em>, and
<em>works</em>, and <em>servants</em>, and <em>ordinances</em>, and profaneth and
dishonoreth his holy <em>name</em> in them all.</p>

<p><em>Obj.</em> <em>Hypocrites</em> professe to glorifie <em>God</em>, and to say,
<cite>Isa. 66.</cite> Let the <em>Lord</em> be glorified.</p>

<p>I answer: No <em>hypocrite</em> can make it his <em>work</em> to <em>glorifie
God</em>, when it crosseth his own <em>glory</em>: No <em>hypocrite</em> can
purely and simply, out of <em>love</em> to <em>Gods name</em> and <em>glory</em>, be
content to loose the offer of a <em>kingdom</em> as <em>Moses</em> did, when
the <em>Lord</em> himself offered it him, and as <em>Christ Jesus</em> did,
when the people offered and would have made him a
<em>King</em> by force, and the <em>devil</em> proffered him all the <em>kingdoms</em>
of the world, and the glory of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Delightfull
privacie with
God argues
strong affection.</div>

<p>Thirdly, it is an <em>Argument</em> of <em>strength</em> of Gods grace
and Spirit in us, when we perform <em>actions</em> of <em>godliness</em>,
with a <em>single</em> and upright <em>eye</em> unto <em>God</em> himself in secret.
<em>Frequent</em> and <em>constant</em> delight in private <em>converses</em> argues
strong <em>affection</em> to <em>God</em> or <em>men</em>: <em>Hypocrites</em> (saith <em>Christ
Jesus</em>) will <em>pray</em> and <em>fast</em>, and give <em>alms</em>, but with a <em>squint</em>
eye of <em>private</em> and <em>sinister</em> self respect to be <em>seen</em> of men,
&amp;c. But <em>Gods children</em> pray, and do good, and fast in
secret, regarding no eye but the eye of an heavenly <em>Father</em>,
who seeing in <em>secret</em> will not fail to reward <em>openly</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ob.</em> But may not <em>hypocrites</em> speak and <em>preach</em> against
<em>hipocrisie</em>, against <em>self-love</em>, <em>self-respect</em>, and <em>fleshly and</em>
worldly <em>ends</em> in the performance of <em>spirituall duties</em>? And
is it not possible for <em>Gods children</em> to perform <em>spirituall
duties</em> with carnall <em>ends</em> and <em>respects</em>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hypocrites
pretend far in
glorifying of
God.</div>

<p>I answer: <em>Hypocrites</em> may do this, and pretend pure
and upright <em>ends</em> for <em>God</em>, as <em>Jehu</em> did: yet discover they
<em>hypocrisie</em>, in the very pretence of <em>sinceritie</em>, for not content
with the <em>Lords</em> eye and approbation, Come see my
<em>zeal</em> (saith he) <em>Jonadab</em>, which I have for the <em>Lord</em>.</p>

<p>2ly, <em>Gods children</em> (doubtless) may look aside, and
mark who <em>sees</em> and <em>hears</em>, and <em>rewards</em> their <em>performances</em>
of <em>service</em> unto <em>God</em>: But this is either in <em>sins</em> of <em>ignorance</em>;
as for <em>instance</em>, many of <em>Gods</em> dear <em>children</em> perform
<em>service</em> to <em>God</em> in <em>preaching</em> as <em>hirelings</em>, and conceive
themselves not bound although to glorifie <em>Christ Jesus</em> in
saving <em>souls</em>) to preach without an <em>hire</em>, and so in other
<em>cases</em>.</p>

<p>Or 3ly, this may be knowingly and discerningly, as
<em>Paul</em> saith, <cite>Rom. 7</cite>. When I would do good, <em>evil</em> is present
with me: such <em>temptations</em> come in as water into a
ship, or as <em>dust</em> and <em>diseases</em> into a sound eye, and then
<em>Gods children</em> be never quiet untill such <em>distempers</em> be
cleansed, and got out again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A frequent &amp;
constant spirit
of prayer an
argument of
much of Gods
Spirit.</div>

<p>Fourthly, it is an <em>Argument</em> of <em>spirituall strength</em> when
the <em>Spirit</em> of <em>prayer</em> breatheth forth <em>frequently</em>, and <em>constantly,
and fervently</em> to <em>God</em> in us: Hence <em>David</em> prays
and cries in the <em>morning</em>, at <em>noon</em>, and in the <em>evening</em>, he
riseth at <em>midnight</em> to pray, and prevents the <em>dawning</em> of
the <em>day</em> to pray: Thus <em>Daniel</em> is thrice each day on his
knees to <em>God</em>, and would not be beaten off, with the
<em>powers</em> and <em>terrors</em> of cruel <em>enemies</em> and <em>lyons</em>.</p>

<p>Thus the Lord <em>Jesus</em> <em>frequently</em> retired alone to private
<em>prayer</em>, and sometimes spent the whole <em>night</em> in <em>prayer</em> to
<em>God</em> with strong <em>cries</em>, <em>tears</em> and <em>supplications</em>: And therefore
is it that all true <em>Christians</em> are the <em>spirituall Israelites</em>,
that is, <em>wrastlers</em> and <em>strivers</em> with <em>God</em> in prayer; like
unto their <em>Father Jacob</em>, who wrastled all night in prayer
with <em>God</em>, with <em>weeping</em> and <em>supplications</em>, and would not
let the <em>Angel</em> go until he blessed him; and therefore his
name was called <em>Israel</em>, a <em>wrastler</em> or <em>prevailer</em> with <em>God</em>,
as well as <em>Jacob</em> a supplanter and prevailer with men.</p>

<p><em>Ob.</em> But may not <em>Hypocrites</em> be frequent and fervent
in prayer to <em>God</em>? Did not the <em>Pharisees</em> and <em>Jews</em> pray
and fast often? Do not the very <em>Turks</em> solemnly pray five
times each 24. houres? And the <em>Papists</em> not onely keep
their solemn morning and evening times of <em>prayer</em>, but
many other solemn prayers unto which the severall orders
of <em>Friars</em>, <em>Monks</em> and <em>Nuns</em> bind themselves? And
how easie is it by worldly engines to wheel about the <em>Indians</em>
of <em>America</em> to become frequent prayers unto God,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>I answer: Many are the differences between the true
prayers of Gods children, and the false of dissemblers
and hypocrites: I will name a few for instance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True prayer
is the souls
breathing unto
God.</div>

<p>First then <em>hypocrites</em> pray but in a <em>form</em> and <em>lip-labour</em>,
as a <em>task</em> and <em>work</em> to be done for <em>carnall respects</em>, to merit
at <em>Gods</em> hand, or to stop the mouth of <em>conscience</em>, which
tels them they cannot be Gods children except they pray:
But true prayer is the pouring out of the heart to God,
the true breathing of the <em>soul</em> to God, arising as <em>Incense</em>
and <em>perfume</em> unto God: Hence (no doubt) although
<em>Paul</em> before his conversion prayed much unto <em>God</em>, (for
he was a Pharasie) yet he never praid <em>indeed</em>, untill his
great <em>change</em>, and the descending of the holy <em>Spirit</em> of
prayer upon him; And therefore the Lord sends <em>Ananias</em>
with this incouragement unto <em>Paul</em>: Behold he
prayeth, <cite>Act. 9</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and hath more
or lesse some
soul-pleasure
in it.</div>

<p>Hence <em>Gods children</em> find a kind of holy <em>pleasure</em> and
<em>delight</em> in <em>prayer</em>, whatever be the event or issue, it pleaseth
<em>God</em> to give, like as a man finds delight in casting off
an heavy <em>burthen</em> from his <em>shoulder</em>, or in the <em>unbossoming</em>
of a <em>grief</em>, into the <em>bosome</em> of a <em>friend</em>. Thus <em>Hanna</em>
opprest with <em>grief</em> weeps no more, when she had <em>powred</em>
forth her <em>supplication</em> before the <em>Lord</em>: And the <em>Lord
Jesus</em> <em>powred</em> forth his <em>prayers</em>, and <em>tears</em>, in the bosome
of his <em>Father</em>, and then rests quiet in his <em>Fathers pleasure</em>,
as touching the <em>passing by</em>, or <em>drinking</em> of the <em>bitter cup</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But may not the <em>children</em> of <em>God</em> want holy
<em>pleasure</em> and <em>delight</em> in prayer, and depart from <em>Gods presence</em>
as <em>heavy</em> as they came?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
are most in
private with
God.</div>

<p>I answer, some <em>spirituall distempers</em> may hinder, and
<em>obstruct</em> the <em>operations</em> of the <em>Spirit of prayer</em>: nevertheles
the <em>soul</em> and <em>spirit</em> praies and mourns for the <em>absence</em> of
holy <em>pleasure</em>, and <em>delight</em> in this holy <em>exercise</em>. Hence
<em>Davids mourning</em> (as a <em>Turtledove</em>) in his <em>prayers</em>, and
<em>Jeremies lamentings</em> for the <em>obstructions</em>, between the <em>Lord</em>
and their <em>souls</em>, in this holy <em>Communion</em>.</p>

<p>The second <em>difference</em> is, the <em>Hypocrites</em> prayers more
respect the <em>ears</em> of <em>men</em> then <em>God</em>, as the <em>Lord Jesus</em> tells
us; They pray that men may know so much, and esteem
them <em>Religious</em>: <em>Gods children</em>, like true <em>lovers</em>, delight
to be private, and fervent with their heavenly
<em>Father</em> and <em>Husband</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prayers
of Gods people
most respect
spiritual
and soul mercies.</div>

<p>Thirdly, <em>Hypocrites</em> in their <em>prayers</em> most commonly
respect <em>earthly</em> things, (and therefore <cite>Hos. 7</cite>.) they cry
and howl upon their <em>Beds</em>, for <em>corn</em> and <em>wine</em>: or at the
best they respect but <em>themselves</em>, &amp;c. although it be in
the <em>pardon</em> of their <em>sins</em>, and <em>saving</em> of their <em>Souls</em>: But
the <em>prayers</em> of <em>Gods children</em>, chiefly eye <em>heavenly</em> things.</p>

<p>Hence the wonderfull <em>spirituallity</em> of <em>Christs prayer</em> to
his <em>Father</em>, (<cite class="no-italics">John 7</cite>.) for the <em>glorifying</em> of his <em>name</em>, and
<em>spirituall Grace</em>, and <em>mercy</em> in the <em>souls</em> of <em>Beleevers</em>: Hence
the admirable <em>spirituality</em> of <em>Davids</em> prayers, for <em>spirituall</em>
and <em>soul</em> mercies, <cite>Psal: 119</cite>. And the fervent prayers of
<em>Paul</em> in all his <cite>Epistles</cite> for heavenly and spirituall mercies
to the <em>Saints</em> of <em>God</em>.</p>

<p><em>Hypocrites</em> like <em>Dogs</em> howl and fawn for <em>bones</em> and <em>crusts</em>,
&amp;c. But <em>Gods</em> children beg the proper <em>tokens</em>, and characters
of a spirituall <em>Father</em>, to his spirituall children, and
Beloved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods people
wait for, and
rest in Gods
answer.</div>

<p>4thly, <em>Hypocrites</em> will not always cry unto <em>God</em> (<cite>Job. 27</cite>.)
but at last with <em>Saul</em>, if <em>God</em> answer not, they run to
the <em>Devill</em> in <em>evil</em> means, murmur and despair: But <em>Gods</em>
children can no more cease to cry unto <em>God</em>, then to live
a spiritual <em>life</em>, and therefore resolve to give <em>God</em> no <em>Rest</em>
untill they receive an <em>answer</em>, and therefore also wait for
his holy <em>pleasure</em>, and <em>leasure</em>, and at last are satisfied with
the <em>Lords</em> holy pleasure, and sentence, although it seem
crosse, add bitter to <em>flesh</em>, and <em>blood</em>: So <em>Moses</em> in respect
of his suit to <em>God</em>, for his going into the land of <em>Canaan</em>:
So <em>David</em> praying for his <em>child</em>: So <em>Christ Jesus</em> in respect
of his <em>bitter cup</em>. So <em>Paul</em> praying against his great
<em>temptation</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But may not <em>Hypocrites</em> pray long, and also wait
upon <em>God</em>?</p>

<p>I answer, they may, yet at last, out of unbelief, and
anger, like an <em>angry Dog</em>, or <em>sturdy Beggar</em>, they cry out
in murmur, and wrath, as the unbelieving King of <em>Israel</em>,
what should I wait upon <em>God</em> any longer? But <em>Gods</em>
children never give over: for when they grow weary,
they (like <em>Moses</em>) beg help to their fainting hands in
<em>prayer</em>, and desire their <em>eyes</em> may never cease trickling
tears unto <em>God</em>, <em>untill</em> he look down from <em>Heaven</em>, <cite>Lament: 2</cite>.</p>

<p>A 5th: Argument of <em>spirituall health</em>, and <em>strength</em>, is
a constant holy sence of our own <em>unworthines</em>, <em>vilenes</em>, and
<em>basenes</em> in <em>Gods</em> presence: Hence <em>Jacob</em> professeth himself
less then the least of <em>Gods</em> mercies, that is, then the least
<em>crum</em>, or <em>drop</em>, or <em>rag</em>, or <em>look</em> of mercy: Hence the <em>Centurion</em>
professeth himself not worthy that <em>Christ</em> should
come under his <em>Roof</em>: Hence <em>Elizabeth</em> her holy wonder,
whence is it (saith she) that the <em>Mother</em> of my <em>Lord</em>
should come unto me? Hence <em>Mephiboseth</em> wonders that
<em>David</em> should look upon such a <em>dead Dog</em>.</p>

<p><i>Ob.</i> But may not <em>Hypocrites</em> professe they are not <em>Papists</em>,
that they can deserve nothing at <em>Gods</em> hands, that
if they had their <em>deserts</em> it were woe with them?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods people
are only truly
sensible of unworthines.</div>

<p>I answer, <em>Hypocrites</em> may say so, but yet are angry
when <em>God</em> seems to deal with them, as he deals with
others. Hence they quarrell with <em>God</em>, as if that <em>God</em>
seemed not to respect their offerings of <em>prayer</em>, and <em>fasting</em>,
<cite class="no-italics">Isa: 58</cite> But <em>Gods</em> children confessing themselves
<em>Beggars</em> at <em>Gods</em> door, and <em>Dogs</em> under his <em>Table</em>, they
wait for, and are humbly thankfull for every <em>crum</em> of
grace and mercy: So <em>Christ Jesus</em> teacheth us to give
thanks for the mercy of a little <em>bread</em>, and then for a little
<em>Fish</em>, (<cite>Mark 6</cite>.) So after most heavy and wonderfull
<em>afflictions</em>, <em>Jeremie</em> cries out <em>Jehova</em> is <em>righteous</em>, and professeth
it is <em>mercy</em> that it is not worse, and that they
were not burnt up and consumed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6thly.</div>

<p>A 6th. Argument of the spiritual <em>health</em> and <em>temper</em>,
is when the <em>affections</em> work strong and lively after <em>God</em>,
after <em>God</em> for himself, after <em>God</em> as a <em>portion</em> and <em>inheritance</em>,
after <em>God</em> as an <em>Husband</em>: when as the <em>Heart</em> panteth
after the <em>water-brooks</em>, so pant our <em>Hearts</em> after <em>God</em>,
when as the thirsty <em>ground</em> longeth for the <em>showers</em> of <em>Rain</em>,
so long our <em>souls</em> after <em>God</em>: When his words are sweeter
then the honey, and honey comb, and of more esteem
then thousands of <em>gold</em> and <em>silver</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ob.</em> But may not <em>Hypocrites</em> (as <em>Balaam</em>) professe so
much and that in earnest?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hypocrite affection
to
God.</div>

<p>I answer, the deceitfull <em>heart</em> of a man will go wonderfull
far this way: Yet certain it is an <em>Hypocrite</em> respects
<em>God</em>, but as a <em>Dog</em> respects his <em>Master</em>, yea sometimes a
<em>stranger</em>, and an <em>Enemy</em> for a crust, or as an <em>Hireling</em> for
his <em>wages</em>: But <em>Gods children</em>, in the want of all things,
are content with <em>God</em> alone, his <em>Christ</em>, his <em>Spirit</em>, his
<em>Favour</em>, his <em>Word</em>, his <em>Ordinances</em>: Hence <em>David</em> professeth
<cite class="no-italics">Psal. 4</cite>. Thou puttest more <em>joy</em> into my <em>heart</em>,
then in the time when their <em>corn</em> and <em>wine</em> increaseth:
And <em>Habacuck</em>, when <em>Vine</em>, and <em>Fig-tree</em>, and <em>Flock</em> and
<em>Heard</em> fail, he professeth to rejoyce in <em>God</em>, and to glory
in the <em>God</em> of his <em>salvation</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God himself
the portion of
his.</div>

<p>2ly. In the losse of all things, in the greatest <em>straights</em>
and <em>extremities</em>, <em>Gods</em> children yet find comfort in <em>God</em>,
that <em>God</em> their portion is not lost. Thus as <em>David</em> when
his <em>wives</em>, and <em>children</em>, and <em>friends</em>, and <em>servants</em>, and
<em>cattell</em> were all devoured by an enslaving and captivating
<em>sword</em>, and he finds no <em>Remainder</em>, but burnt <em>walls</em> and
<em>ashes</em>, and his own company ready to <em>stone</em> him, yet as
<em>David</em> they take comfort, and incourage themselves injoying
their <em>God</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7thly.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ready obedience
to God.</div>

<p>7tly. It is an argument of spirituall <em>health</em>, and
<em>strength</em>, when the holy <em>Commandments</em> of <em>God</em> are not
grievous, but pleasant and delightfull to us: when we
can say as the <em>Lord Jesus</em> said, it is our meat and drink,
to do our heavenly <em>Fathers will</em>: when we are active and
ready at the <em>commands</em> of <em>God</em>, and can say (when the
<em>Lord</em> asketh whom shall we send) <em>send</em> me, as the <em>Prophet
Esay</em> said: And as the <em>Lord Jesus</em> Psal: 40. Here I
am, I delight to do thy will O my God: when we can
without repining, grudging, or delaying, obey <em>commands</em>
most grievous to <em>flesh</em> and <em>blood</em>, against not only <em>flesh</em> and
<em>blood</em>, but against carnall <em>reason</em>, yea against <em>Hope</em> and
<em>Faith</em> it self, as <em>Abraham</em> did, in offering up his most
dear and only son <em>Isaac</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But may not <em>Hypocrites</em> obey the <em>commands</em> of
<em>God</em>, as <em>Saul</em> did, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

<p>I answer, they may indeed obey <em>Gods commands</em> by
halves as he did, and as a <em>servant</em>, and <em>hireling</em>, serve <em>God</em>
for <em>wages</em>, and with <em>eye service</em>, with opinion of <em>merit</em>,
and boast of their <em>halt</em> and <em>lame</em> service, as <em>Saul did</em>. But
<em>Gods</em> children imbrace all the <em>commands</em> of <em>God</em> with delight,
even the <em>least</em>, and most despised, with the greatest
and most <em>difficult</em>, and when all is done, they confesse
they have need of <em>mercy</em>, and are <em>unprofitable Servants</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But may not <em>Gods</em> children live in the <em>disobedience</em>
of some <em>commands</em> of <em>God</em>, and yet be healthfull, and
strong in grace?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sins of
Gods people.</div>

<p>I answer, it is impossible that a child of <em>God</em> should
(either in spirituall <em>health</em> or <em>sicknes</em>) live in the breach
of any known <em>command</em> of <em>God</em> his <em>Father</em>. Tis true,
<em>Abraham</em>, and <em>Jacob</em>, and <em>David</em>, and others, lived long
in the sin of many wives, out of <em>ignorance</em> of <em>Gods will</em>,
and <em>Gods</em> children to this day, even the holy <em>Martyrs</em> or
<em>Witnesses</em> of <em>Jesus</em>, (who accounted their heart bloods
not too dear for <em>Christ</em>) have and do live in the breach
of many <em>Commandments</em>, that concern the <em>worship</em> of <em>God</em>:
But they are herein like a <em>traveller</em> deceived, by a false
path, which when he once really <em>suspects</em>, he cannot walk
a step with ease, now do they cry out with <em>David</em>, <cite class="no-italics">Psal:
119</cite>. I will walk at <em>liberty</em>, for I seek thy precepts: And
when <em>God</em> saith seek my <em>Face</em>, their <em>Hearts</em> answer, <em>Lord</em>
thy face will I seek. <cite class="no-italics">Psalm 27</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8thly</div>

<div class="sidenote">The patience
of Gods children,
under
Gods hand.</div>

<p>An 8th. discovery of <em>spirituall health</em> and <em>strength</em>, is
an humble, a patient and thankfull <em>submission</em> to the <em>aflicting</em>,
and <em>chastising</em> hand of <em>God</em>. Thus it is said of <em>Aaron</em>,
in that dreadfull stroak of <em>Gods</em> hand, depriving him of his
two sons in the <em>floure</em> of their <em>Youth</em>, in the midst of their
<em>sin</em>, in the <em>performance</em> of their <em>Priests Office</em>: it is said,
<em>Aaron</em> held his peace: I was dumb and held my peace,
(saith <em>David</em>) <cite class="no-italics">Psal. 39</cite>. for thou didst it: Thus <em>Jeremiah</em>
(Lam: 1.) <em>Jehovah</em> is righteous, for I have grievously
transgrest against him. Yea <em>Job</em> not only exprest
an humble and patient mind, but also (which is wonderfull,
but proper to <em>Gods</em> children, when in right temper)
he blessed <em>God</em> in the midst of so many fearfull and astonishing
<em>losses</em>, of so many Cattel, Servants, and Children,
saying, Blessed be the name of the <em>Lord</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> May not <em>wicked</em> men and <em>Hypocrites</em> acknowledg
<em>Gods</em> afflicting hand, and humble themselves?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The counterfeit
patience
of Hypocrites</div>

<p>I answer, <em>Hypocrites</em> may see <em>Gods</em> hand, and humble
themselves as the <em>Egyptians</em>, and the <em>Philistins</em> did, but cannot
possibly be thankfull for it: They acknowledg <em>Gods</em>
hand as a <em>Dog</em> his <em>Masters</em> when he is beaten, but not as
a child his <em>Fathers</em>. As a loving and dutifull <em>Wife</em>, receiving
<em>Pills</em> or <em>Phisick</em> from the hand of her loving
<em>Husband</em>, a <em>skilfull Physitian</em>, who knows her <em>sicknes</em>, and
out of <em>love</em> and <em>care</em>, prepares them for her, she cannot
but be thankfull for those bitter <em>medicins</em>, and earnestly
desire a kindly working: Thus <em>David</em>, <cite class="no-italics">Psal: 119</cite>. I know
O <em>Lord</em> that thou in <em>faithfulnesse</em> hast afflicted me, for all
thy commands are <em>righteous</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9thly.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The mournful
confession of
Gods people.</div>

<p>A 9th. Argument of <em>spiritual health</em>, and <em>strength</em>, is
an humble free <em>confession</em>, and giving <em>glory</em> unto <em>God</em>, in
the rising up, or recovering out of any <em>scandalous transgression</em>,
against <em>God</em> Hence the <em>Israelites</em> confession of
their sin in desiring a <em>King</em>, (so impatiently, and imperiously
as they did, with large confessions, <cite class="no-italics">1. Sam. 6</cite>.)</p>

<p>Hence the many bitter and lamentable <em>confessions</em> of
holy <em>David</em> and other holy Servants of <em>God</em>, after their
committing of <em>known evils</em>: Hence the <em>Corinthians</em> repenting
of their fellowship with the <em>incestuous</em> person in
his sin, they give such an exemplary <em>evidence</em> of their true
<em>Repentance</em>, that their holy <em>practice</em> is set as an holy <em>Samplar</em>,
and <em>Copy</em> for all <em>Saints</em> afterward to follow, and write after.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But did not <em>Pharaoh</em>, <em>Saul</em> and <em>Judas</em> confesse
their sins, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">1.</div>

<p>I answer, not with intent to glorifie <em>God</em> as <em>Gods</em> Saints
do, taking shame before the <em>world</em> unto themselves, lying
down in the Dust that <em>God</em> may tread upon them, and
be exalted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2.</div>

<div class="sidenote">False confessions.</div>

<p>Not with hatred of their <em>sins</em>, but in horrour and
trouble at the <em>danger</em> of them, or in the <em>evidence</em> of them
flying in their faces. Thus a <em>Merchant</em> casteth those <em>goods</em>
over boord into the <em>sea</em> in a storme, which afterward he
wisheth in again: Like a <em>Dog</em>, they vomit up the filth
which (after their <em>stomach</em> is eased) they return unto, and
lick up by new <em>Commissions</em>: But Gods <em>children</em> confesse in
hatred of their <em>sins</em>, and loathing of themselves, and (like
men in some <em>sicknesses</em>) are willing to take those <em>medicines</em>
which may <em>provoke</em> and cause <em>vomit</em>, which afterward they
are so far from returning to, that they abhor to touch,
or look on it.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But may not <em>Gods</em> children return again to their
vomit, and commit the same <em>sins</em>, which they have cast,
up by humble <em>confession</em>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sins of
Gods people
distinguished.</div>

<p>I answer, the sins of <em>Gods children</em> are either, 1. <em>grosse</em>
or <em>scandalous</em>, which when they recover out of, and give
<em>glory</em> unto <em>God</em>, by <em>publike</em> confession, we seldome or never
find them returning to such their <em>vomit</em> again. Hence
we hear no more of <em>Noahs Drunkennesse</em>, of <em>David's Adultry</em>,
of <em>Peters deniall</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Or 2ly. Their <em>sins</em> are <em>sins</em> of a more private and ordinary
<em>distemper</em>, wherein their <em>passions</em> of <em>anger</em>, or <em>neglect</em>,
or <em>forgetfullnes</em> prevail against them, never without some
<em>bitternes</em>, and <em>grief</em>, and <em>humiliation</em>, and <em>endeavour</em>, with
<em>resolution</em> of a more watchfull, and heavenly, and spirituall
<em>conversation</em>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">10thly.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gods people
long alter visible
enjoyments
of God.</div>

<p>10thly. It is an <em>argument</em> of <em>spiritual health</em>, and <em>strength</em>,
to <em>maintain</em> or <em>recover</em> an holy vehement longing, after
the <em>enjoyment</em> of <em>God</em>, and of <em>Christ</em>, in a <em>visible</em>, and <em>open
profession</em> of his own holy <em>worship</em> and <em>Ordinances</em>, separate
from all false <em>worships</em>, <em>Gods</em>, and <em>Christs</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Hence that of <em>David</em>, <em>Lord</em> I have loved the <em>Habitation</em>
of thy <em>house</em>, and the place where thine <em>honour</em>
dwelleth: Hence he professeth he had rather be a <em>Door
keeper</em> in the house of the <em>Lord</em>, (that is in a low condition,
in <em>Gods</em> house,) then to dwell in the <em>tents</em> of <em>wickednes</em>,
though in never so safe and pleasant a <em>condition</em>.</p>

<p>Hence he sums up all his <em>desires</em> in one, <cite>Psal: 27</cite>.
One thing have I desired of the <em>Lord</em>, that I may dwell
in the house of the <em>Lord</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Hence (though <em>David</em> mist of the <em>Lords Order</em> in carrying
of the <em>Lords Ark</em>, and afterwards he mist in his
<em>thoughts</em> about the building of <em>God</em> an <em>house</em> and <em>Temple</em>:
Yet in both he discovered his holy strong <em>affection</em>, to
<em>Gods</em> publike <em>honour</em>, and <em>worship</em>. The very same
which afterward the Prophet <em>Jeremy</em>, and <em>Daniel</em> declared
in their bitter <em>Lamentations</em>, for the <em>Ruine</em> of <em>Gods</em> house.
And both <em>Daniel</em> and <em>Zacharie</em>, and <em>Haggie</em>, mightily declare
this <em>affection</em> for the <em>rebuilding</em>, and setting up again
this <em>Temple</em> and <em>worship</em> of <em>God</em>, and what they prophesied,
that both <em>Ezra</em> and <em>Nehemiah</em>, and afterward <em>Jehoshua</em>
and <em>Zerubabel</em> zealously performed and executed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True Christians
affection
to Christ Jesus
in his visible

<p>Hence it is that in the heavenly <em>Love Song</em>, the <em>love</em>
of <em>Christians</em> to <em>Christ Jesus</em> in his <em>ordinances</em> is most
elegantly set forth by a <em>similitude</em> taken from the <em>strong
affection</em> of <em>married</em> persons: I am, saith the <em>Spouse, sick</em>
of <em>love</em>, and O ye daughters of <em>Jerusalem</em> tell <em>Christ Jesus</em>
so: If I finde him without I will <em>kisse</em> him openly in the
<em>streets</em>, and will not be ashamed: True heavenly <em>affection</em>
(like <em>marriage love</em>) at first kindles from some private
<em>sparks</em>, to an open flame of publick <em>profession</em>, without
shame before all men.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> May not <em>Hypocrites</em> (as <em>Saul</em> in slaying the <em>Gibeonites</em>,
and <em>Jehu</em> in slaying the <em>Baalites</em>) discover strong <em>affection</em>
and <em>zeal</em> to the <em>Lord</em> and his <em>worship</em>, and consequently
in these times to Christ <em>Jesus</em> and his holy <em>kingdom</em>?</p>

<p>I answer: <em>Hypocrites</em> and <em>counterfeits</em> in their profession
of <em>love</em> to <em>Gods</em> publick worship ever run upon one of
these two <em>Rocks</em>. For,</p>

<p>First, either they set up, and maintain, and fight for
a <em>fancie</em>, a <em>counterfeit</em>, a false <em>Christ</em>, according to the <em>prophesie</em>
of the Lord <em>Jesus</em>, that many (that is, <em>thousands</em>
and <em>multitudes</em> of people) should so use his <em>name</em>, that is,
with a willing ignorance and delusion.</p>

<p>Or 2ly, if it be the true <em>worship</em> of the true <em>God</em> according
to the <em>appointment</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, yet ever in two
things the sincere <em>wife</em> (the true love of <em>Christ Jesus</em>) out-goes
the <em>whore</em> and <em>counterfeit</em>.</p>

<p>First, the true <em>wife</em> contents not herself with the bare
<em>exercise</em>, <em>ordinance</em> or <em>administration</em> (as the <em>hypocrites</em> do)
but in all is restless to enjoy the <em>Lord</em> himself: For as
the <em>ordinance</em> is <em>spirituall</em>, and heavenly; so longs the
true <em>beleever</em> for a <em>spirituall</em> and heavenly <em>communion</em> with
the <em>Lord</em> himself in it, that he may become one <em>spirit</em>
with him more and more in all these outward and <em>subordinate
means</em> and <em>administrations</em>.</p>

<p>Hence it pleaseth the <em>Spirit</em> of <em>God</em> to resemble his
<em>worship</em> to the <em>marriage bed</em>, which satisfies not the heavenly
<em>Spouse</em>, when the <em>Husband Christ Jesus</em>, is not spiritually
embraced therein, but absent.</p>

<p>2ly, The desire of the true <em>beleever</em> in the enjoyment
of <em>Christ Jesus</em> in any of his <em>appointments</em> is to be made
<em>fruitfull</em> by him: but the desire of a <em>whore</em> extends no
further then <em>Lust</em> or a <em>Reward</em>. Hence <cite>Rom. 7</cite>. We are
married unto <em>Christ Jesus</em>, that we should bring forth
<em>fruit</em> unto <em>God</em>: A <em>whoorish heart</em> willingly endures not
<em>fruitfulnes</em>, but kills her own <em>conceptions</em> which the true
<em>Wife</em> cherisheth, and tendreth as her <em>life</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> What should be the <em>reason</em> why so many of <em>Gods
children</em> who in all <em>ages</em> have discovered their strong <em>affection</em>
to <em>Gods</em> visible <em>worship</em>, and <em>communion</em> in <em>Christ</em>,
have yet so varied, and wandred from the right, and first
<em>institution</em> of the <em>Church</em>, and <em>ministry</em>, and <em>Ordinances</em> of
<em>worship</em>?</p>

<p>I answer, Gods <em>councell</em> touching the <em>spirituall captivity</em>,
and <em>desolation</em>, must be fulfilled, when yet notwithstanding,
the strength of the <em>affection</em> of <em>Gods</em> people hath appear'd
in their <em>mourning</em> and <em>weeping</em>, and lamenting
after, and contending for the truth of the <em>spiritual injoyment</em>
of their souls <em>Beloved</em>, in all the <em>means</em> of his own
holy <em>appointments</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11thly.</div>

<p>11thly. Again it is an <em>Argument</em> of <em>spirituall health</em>, &amp;
strength, in respect of <em>God</em>, when the <em>Heart</em> is fixed, and
readily prepared for all the holy <em>pleasure</em> of <em>God</em>. Hence
<em>Hezekiah</em> praies for such whose <em>hearts</em> were prepared to
seek <em>Jehovah, God</em> of their <em>Fathers</em>: Hence this <em>readines</em>,
and <em>preparation</em> of mind, is compared to the <em>shoes</em> on our
<em>Feet</em>, without which we are unfit for <em>travelling</em>, <em>walking</em>,
&amp;c. and with which we are <em>ready</em> for any <em>spirituall imployment</em>.
Hence <em>David</em> professeth that his <em>heart</em> was fixed,
and ready, and when the <em>Lord</em> said seek my <em>Face</em>, <em>Davids
heart</em> answered, <em>Lord</em>, thy <em>Face</em> will I seek, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> What is the reason that <em>Gods children</em> are sometimes
hardly brought on to difficult <em>services</em>, and <em>duties</em>?</p>

<p>I answer, <em>unreadines</em>, and <em>unfitnes</em> is a <em>spirituall sicknes</em>
or <em>distemper</em>, which when <em>Gods children</em> recover out of,
then they say as the <em>Lord Jesus</em> in <em>David</em> <cite class="no-italics">Psal: 41</cite>. <em>Lord</em>
my <em>heart</em> is willing, my <em>heart</em> is ready to do thy will O
my <em>God</em>: And they say to <em>Christ Jesus</em>, as his holy servant
<em>John Bradford</em> said to <em>Queen Mary</em>; If she keep me
in <em>prison</em>, I will thank her; If she <em>release</em> me I will <em>thank</em>
her; If she <em>burn</em> me, I will still <em>thank her</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12thly</div>

<p>Lastly, it is an <em>Argument</em> of <em>spirituall health</em>, and
<em>strength</em> when <em>Gods children</em> walk in a continuall sence of
their own <em>insufficiencies</em>, and <em>distempers</em>, when they discern
the evill <em>inclination</em> of their own <em>spirits</em>, and the <em>excellency</em>,
and <em>sufficiency</em> of <em>Gods</em> most holy <em>Spirit</em>: And therefore
continually say with <em>David</em>, <cite class="no-italics">Psalme 143</cite>. Thy <em>Spirit</em> is
good, lead me, <i>&amp;c.</i> and Psal. 139. Search me O <em>God</em>,
and try my <em>heart</em>, and see if thou findest any way of
<em>wickednes in me, and lead me in the way everlasting</em>.</p>

<p>These and many more, are the <em>trials</em> of <em>spirituall
strength</em>, <em>health</em>, and <em>cheerfulnes</em>, in matters concerning <em>God</em>:
We now come to the second Head of <em>trialls</em> of <em>spirituall
health</em>, and <em>strength</em>, in matters concerning our selves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brokennes of
spirit.</div>

<p>First, then it is an Argument of <em>spiritual health</em>, and
<em>strength</em>, when (especially) after known sins committed,
our <em>hearts</em> are in a <em>broken</em> frame and temper, when our
<em>spirits</em> are as it were <em>contrite</em>, and pounded like <em>spice in a</em>
Morter, then yeelding the most delightfull <em>smell</em> and
<em>savour</em> unto <em>God</em>.</p>

<p>Hence (<cite class="no-italics">Isa. 66</cite>) a <em>contrite</em>, and broken heart is an
<em>House</em> wherein <em>God</em> dwels, an House well ordered, <em>swept</em>,
and <em>garnished</em>.</p>

<p>Hence a <em>Spirit</em> of <em>trembling</em>, (<cite>Isa. 66</cite>.) is an <em>Argument</em>
and <em>character</em> of the most dutifull <em>children</em> of <em>God</em>: but
of this formerly.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>2dly.</p>

<p>Spirituall battels.</p></div>

<p>2ndly. It is an <em>Argument</em> of <em>spirituall strength</em>, when
we make it our <em>work</em> to <em>observe</em>, <em>watch</em>, and kill our <em>corruptions</em>,
and <em>rebellions</em>, and labour to keep under, and
beat down our <em>body</em> to an holy fitnes, and readines for
<em>Gods service</em>, in <em>fasting</em>, and <em>prayer</em> against <em>temptations</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But may not <em>Hypocrites</em> humble themselves, and
labour to mortifie their <em>lusts</em> and <em>corruptions</em>?</p>

<p>I answer, no question, but in horrour of <em>conscience</em>, and
fear of <em>Gods judgments</em>, an <em>Hypocrite</em> may humble
himself in fasting, as <em>Ahab</em>, &amp;c. but to kill sin, as sin, and
to desire to be ready for <em>Gods</em> will, in <em>denying</em>, and <em>subduing</em>
his own, is only the <em>character</em> and property of a
child of <em>God</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3dly.
Godly loathing
for sin.</div>

<p>3dly. It is an <em>Argument</em> of <em>spirituall health</em>, and <em>strength</em>,
when we so look upon our <em>sins</em>, and our sinfull <em>dispositions</em>,
that we not only loath our <em>sins</em>, but also loath our selves
for them: So saith the <em>Lord</em>, (<cite>Ezek 6</cite>.) My <em>people</em> shall
loath themselves for their <em>abominations</em>, and for their
<em>whoorish heart</em> against me: Thus <em>Job</em> when he recovers
himself from his <em>murmurings</em> against <em>God</em>, he cries out,
Behold I abhor my self, and repent in <em>dust</em>, and <em>ashes</em>.
And <em>David</em> (<cite class="no-italics">Psal: 73</cite>.) looks upon himself for his murmuring
against <em>Gods providence</em>, as an <em>ignorant</em> person, as
a <em>fool</em> and a <em>beast</em> in <em>Gods</em> presence.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But may not an <em>Hypocrite</em> loath and abhor
himself for <em>sin</em>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hypocrites
may in a respect
loath
themselves
for sin.</div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, It is possible for an <em>Hypocrite</em> to be sorry for
some <em>sins</em>, and to be angry with <em>himselfe</em>, and to loath
himselfe, but not properly for his <em>sins</em>, which he loveth,
but (as <em>theeves, whores, drunkards, &amp;c.</em>) for the <em>danger</em>,
<em>damage</em> and <em>disgrace</em> which his sin may bring upon him.
It is onely the property of <em>Gods children</em> to look at <em>sin</em>
as <em>sin</em>, with a loathing <em>eye</em>, and to behold themselves <em>vile</em>
and <em>loathsome</em>, even for the most <em>pleasing</em> and <em>profitable</em>,
and <em>delightfull</em>, and most <em>secret sins</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fourthly.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">True selfe
denyall.</div>

<p>Fourthly, It is an <em>Argument</em> of the <em>strength</em> of <em>Spirituall
life</em>, when we lay downe our selves at the feet of <em>God</em>,
when as a <em>Servants will</em>, our <em>wils</em> are subdued to the
<em>Lords will</em>, when the <em>Lord</em> is become our <em>selfe</em>, when his
<em>ends</em> are our <em>ends</em>, which give us content and <em>pleasure</em>,
although our <em>selves</em>, our <em>ends</em> are lost and destroyed, that
wee may finde new <em>ends</em> and <em>delights</em> in <em>God</em>.</p>

<p>Hence <em>Epaphroditus</em> to further the worke of the <em>Lord</em>
(<cite>Phil. 2</cite>) he regarded not his health, and consequently
not his <em>life</em>; as a true <em>Souldier</em> in the Service of his heavenly
<em>King</em> and <em>Captaine</em>.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But may not an <em>Hypocrite</em> deny himselfs; his
owne <em>ends</em>, his <em>pleasures</em>, his <em>profits</em>, his <em>credit</em>, his <em>liberty</em>,
his <em>life</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No Hypocrite
can truly deny
himselfe.</div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, It is impossible; for all that he doth is still
for <em>himselfe</em>: like <em>Israel</em>, <em>Hosea</em> 7. He is an <em>empty vine</em>,
he bringeth forth fruit to <em>himself</em>: All that he aims at in
using the name of <em>God</em>, his <em>glory</em>, his <em>Christ</em>, is still to
exalt <em>himselfe</em>, to save <em>himselfe</em>: But <em>Gods children</em> eye ever
a greater <em>end</em> then <em>selfe</em>, to wit, the glorifying of their
<em>God</em>, although it be in their own <em>destructions</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fifthly.</i></div>

<p>Fifthly, Our hearts are then in an healthfull frame
and disposition, when we are <em>cordially</em> willing to goe from
hence, that we may be with <em>Christ</em>, <cite>Phil. 3</cite>. yet for the
service of <em>Christ</em> and his <em>Saints</em>, we are cordially willing
to stay in <em>hard</em> and <em>difficult</em> Service.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But may not an <em>Hypocrite</em> desire to dye, and
to be with <em>Christ</em>?</p>

<p><em>I answer</em>, An <em>Hypocrite</em> may desire to dye, and to be
with <em>Christ</em> in a glorious <em>condition</em>, but no <em>Hypocrite</em> can
endure to dye, to be with <em>Christ</em> in an holy and spirituall
<em>condition</em>, free from <em>sin</em>: and therefore can he not
endure uprightly, &amp;c. to <em>worke</em> for <em>Christ</em> on <em>Earth</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sixtly.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Spirituall
contentation
in Gods will.</div>

<p>Sixthly, Then are we in an healthfull <em>frame</em> of <em>Grace</em>,
when <em>God</em> hath brought down our <em>hearts</em> to be content
with the changes of his <em>right-hand</em> upon us: when we
have learnt the <em>lesson</em> of <em>Paul</em>, to be content with <em>food</em>
and <em>raiment</em>, with a <em>travellers</em> and <em>strangers portion</em>, of so
much as may serve us in our <em>Journey</em>: When we can
tell how to abound without <em>Pride</em>, or <em>security</em>, or <em>trust</em> in
earthly things, and when we can tell how to want all
outward <em>mercies</em> with <em>quietnesse</em> and <em>contentation</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But may not <em>Hypocrites</em> be contented with smal
<em>matters</em>, and suppresse their desires of great <em>things</em>, and say
with <em>Esau</em> unto <em>Jacob</em>: Keep that thou hast <em>my brother</em>,
I have enough?</p>

<div class="sidenote">All changes
and losses are
made up to
Gods people
only by himselfe.</div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, the desires of all men are not alike <em>greedy</em>;
but yet the desires of men are truely satisfied without
<em>God</em>: Now when <em>changes</em> and the <em>losse</em> of all things fall
upon the <em>Hypocrite</em>, he cannot finde those <em>changes</em> and
those <em>losses</em> made up in <em>God</em>: No <em>Habakkuk</em> tels us, That
it is the <em>Character</em> of <em>Gods</em> children, when the <em>corne</em> is
gone, and the <em>flocks</em> and the <em>heards</em>, and the <em>vine</em>, and the
<em>figtree</em> faile, to rejoyce in <em>God</em> alone for a <em>portion</em>, and to
<em>glory</em> in the <em>God</em> of their <em>Salvation</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Seventhly.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Joy in Sorrow.</div>

<p>Seventhly, Then are our hearts in an <em>healthfull</em> frame,
when we are not onely willing to suffer for the name of
<em>Christ Jesus</em>, but when we also conceive a kinde of <em>pleasure</em>
in it; so saith <em>Paul</em>, I take <em>pleasure</em> in <em>necessities</em>, in
<em>distresses</em>, and for <em>Christs</em> sake; Hence the Saints (<cite>Heb. 13. 10</cite>)
not onely suffered the spoyling of their <em>goods</em>,
but they took the spoyling of their <em>goods</em> with <em>joy</em>.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> May not <em>Hipocrites</em> suffer joyfully for <em>Christ?</em></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hypocrites
pretend to
suffer for
Christ.</div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, An <em>Hypocrite</em> may doe and suffer with a
seeming <em>joy</em> for <em>Christ</em>: But he can never doe this out
of <em>love</em> to <em>Christ</em>, <cite>1 Cor. 13</cite>. but always out of <em>self-love</em>
for his owne <em>glory</em> and <em>honour</em>, out of strong conviction
of <em>conscience</em>, least he be damned in denying his <em>light</em>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
Onely <em>Gods children</em> can out of <em>love</em> to <em>Christ Jesus</em> rejoyce
(as some true <em>friend</em> or <em>wife</em>) to be <em>afflicted</em> and to <em>sorrow</em>
and loose for their <em>Souls beloved</em>.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Why then are many of <em>Gods children</em> so <em>heavy</em>
in their <em>sufferings</em> and <em>losses</em> for <em>Christ Jesus</em>?</p>

<p><em>I answer</em>, This hapneth sometimes out of distemper of
<em>body</em>; sometimes out of distemper and weaknesse of
<em>minde</em>, which they labour against, and chide themselves
for as did <em>David</em>, <cite>Psal. 42. &amp; 43.</cite> why art thou disquieted
O my <em>Soul</em>, and why art thou so heavy within me?
still trust in GOD, for I will praise him, who is the
<em>health</em> of my <em>countenance</em> and my <em>God</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Eightly.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Christian
weanedness
from this
worlds comforts.</div>

<p>Eighthly, It argues strength of <em>Grace</em> when we use this
<em>world</em>, and all the <em>comforts</em> of it with a <em>weaned eye</em> and
<em>mind</em>, as if we used it not: as <em>English Travellers</em> that
lodge in an <em>Indian</em> house, use all the wild <em>Indians</em> comforts
with a strange <em>affection</em>, willing and ready to be
gone: or as <em>Passengers</em> in a <em>Ship</em>, willing and ready (when
<em>God</em> will) to land, and goe ashoar in our own <em>countrey</em>,
to our owne <em>House</em>, and <em>comforts</em> in the <em>Heavens</em>.</p>

<p>Thus <em>Gideons</em> Souldiers (in a figure of such as are fit
for <em>Christs Battels</em>) are not only <em>couragious</em> and depart not
with the <em>cowards</em>, but also lap at the <em>comforts</em> of this life,
with a speedy <em>necessity</em>, but lye not downe to them in
<em>excesse</em> of <em>affection</em> and <em>delight</em>.</p>

<p><em>Object.</em> May not <em>Hypocrites</em> use this world with a
strange <em>affection</em>, weaned from the vanities of it, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The heavenly
use of earthly
comforts.</div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, Doubtlesse not onely a false <em>Christian</em> or
<em>Hypocrite</em>, but other naturall men (out of the <em>sence</em> and
<em>experience</em> of the <em>vanitie</em> and <em>uncertainty</em> of this life, and
the <em>comforts</em> of it) may attaine to a great seeming <em>dispising</em>
of these <em>earthly things</em>, though never without <em>sorrow</em> that
they are not more <em>full</em> and <em>certain</em>, as being their <em>portion</em>:
Onely <em>Gods children</em> who have made the <em>Lord</em> himselfe
their portion, and his <em>word</em> and <em>Ordinances</em> their <em>inheritance</em>,
they only I say use them as from <em>God</em>, tokens of
his <em>Love</em> and <em>goodnesse</em>, and as <em>golden chaines</em> to draw them
unto him, and humbly submit to <em>Gods</em> holy pleasure, in
his gracious <em>bestowing</em> or <em>withdrawing</em> of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ninthly.</i></div>

<p>Ninthly, It is an <em>argument</em> of a strong <em>fear</em> of and
<em>affection</em> to <em>God</em>, when in all our earthly businesses, we see
<em>God</em>, and minde his <em>name</em> and <em>praise</em>. Hence saith <em>James</em>:
Yee ought in all Journeys and purposes to say, If <em>God</em>
will: Hence <em>Boaz</em> that holy man, when he comes into
his <em>Field</em> hath <em>God</em> in his <em>mouth</em>: The <em>Lord</em> blesse you
sayed he to his <em>Reapers</em>: Hence the poorest <em>Christian</em>
able to contribute (<cite>1 Cor. 16</cite>.) observes <em>weekly</em>, and
therefore <em>daily</em> the <em>dispensations</em> of <em>God</em> towards him; He
observes the <em>givings</em> and <em>takings</em> of <em>Gods</em> hand, and walks
with him though in the poorest and meanest <em>calling</em> and
<em>condition</em>.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But may not <em>Hypocrites</em> observe <em>Gods</em> blessing
in <em>worldly</em> things, in <em>faire winds</em>, <em>good voyages</em>, in the <em>encrease</em>
of <em>children</em>, <em>corne</em>, <em>wine</em>, <em>cattel</em>, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The glorifying
of God
proper to
Gods children
only.</div>

<p><em>I answer, Naturall conviction</em> enforceth even <em>Pagans</em> to
confesse (a <em>Manittoo</em>) an <em>Invisible Deity</em> and <em>God-head</em> in
these visible things; But to make it a <em>worke</em> and <em>Businesse</em>
in all these earthly things to see and <em>glorifie God</em>, to
walke with him, and to be full of his <em>praise</em> all the day
long; this is onely the <em>Character</em> of <em>Gods children</em>, who
only truly see his <em>hand</em>, and love his <em>name</em> and <em>glory</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tenthly.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The true
watch of
Gods people
over their
Tongue.</div>

<p>Tenthly, It is an <em>Argument</em> of strength and vigour of
<em>grace</em>, to keep a constant <em>watch</em> and <em>bridle</em> on our <em>lips</em> and
<em>tongue</em>, that no words passe but such as are seasoned with
<em>Salt</em>, to the <em>glorifying</em> of our <em>Maker</em> with our <em>glory</em>, and
the <em>edifying</em> or <em>benefiting</em> of others. This <em>Tongue</em> of ours
the <em>Lord</em> compares to the <em>bridle</em> of a <em>Horse</em>, to the <em>Helm</em>
of a <em>Ship</em>, which if well managed rules the <em>horse</em> and <em>ship</em>,
with <em>safety</em> and <em>comfort</em>: and the <em>Spirit</em> of <em>God</em> concludes;
that he is a <em>perfect</em> and <em>strong</em> man in <em>Christ</em>, that is thus
able to command his <em>Speech</em> and <em>Tongue</em> in this world.</p>

<p>Hence <em>Christ Jesus</em> preacheth <em>Judgement</em> to the <em>world</em>,
for the <em>abuse</em> of the <em>Tongue</em>, and the <em>idle words</em> of it, when
our <em>words</em> are not <em>working words</em>, and tend not to heavenly
profiting of others.</p>

<p>Hence the <em>Spirit</em> by <em>Paul</em> commands (<cite>Ephes.5</cite>.) that
neither <em>uncleannesse</em>, nor <em>covetousnesse</em>, nor <em>foolish talking</em>,
nor <em>jeasting</em>, be once heard from the mouths of the
<em>Saints</em>, but rather giving of <em>thanks</em>, and praising of <em>God</em>.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But may not <em>worldly</em> persons set a watch before
the door of their <em>lips</em>?</p>

<p><em>I answer, Morall wisdome</em> may teach persons the <em>vanity</em>
and grosse <em>wickednesse</em> of the <em>Tongue</em>, but onely <em>Gods spirit</em>
(and strength of it) doth teach <em>Gods children</em>, in true <em>feare</em>
and <em>love</em> of <em>God</em>, not onely to <em>restraine</em> from <em>vaine</em> and
<em>foolish</em>, but also to attaine to a <em>spirituall</em> and <em>heavenly
Language</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, It argues strength and life and <em>Grace</em> in <em>Christ</em>,
when our <em>hearts</em> by <em>Gods spirit</em> are wrought to such a
degree of <em>hatred</em> of sin, that we not onely abhor the <em>acts</em>
thereof, but also fly and shun the <em>looks</em> and <em>appearance</em> of
it; so that we not only fly <em>pride</em> and <em>passion</em>, and <em>covetousnesse</em>
and <em>uncleannesse</em>, but also the <em>appearance</em> of them.</p>

<p>Hence <em>Boaz</em>, when <em>Ruth</em> lay downe at his feet in the
night, as claiming <em>marriage</em> by <em>right</em>, he not only refrained
from <em>uncleannesse</em>, or uncleane <em>touches</em>, but also he
gravely advised her to be gone so early in the morning,
that no man should say there came a woman into the floar.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But may not <em>worldly</em> persons not only avoid
sin, but also the <em>appearance</em> of it?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Only Gods
children can
truly hate sin.</div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, No <em>worldly</em> or <em>unregenerate person</em> can truly
hate <em>sin</em>, or the appearance of it, for it is his <em>nature</em> and
<em>Element</em>, they can onely hate the <em>dammages</em> and <em>disgrace</em>,
and <em>discredit</em> of it, and so a <em>Whore</em> may hate <em>whoredome</em>.
'Tis only the <em>property</em> of <em>Gods</em> children, and the <em>new-borne</em>
to hate <em>sin</em> as <em>sin</em>, with the sinfull <em>appearances</em> of it
as <em>opposite</em> to their <em>new</em> and <em>heavenly</em> nature in <em>Jesus
Christ</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I now come to the third head of the tryals of spirituall
<em>health</em> and <em>strength</em>, and that respects our <em>conversation</em>
with men, in which</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ and
Christians
worke to glorify
God in
doing good.</div>

<p>First I argue, that it is a strong <em>argument</em> of a strong
<em>constitution</em> and <em>spirituall health</em>, when we can make it our
<em>worke</em> and <em>trade</em>, to aime at <em>glorifying</em> our <em>Maker</em> in doing
good to men.</p>

<p>Thus our great example <em>Christ Jesus</em> made it his
<em>worke</em> and <em>trade</em>, to goe about to doe <em>good</em>, which he did
abundantly and constantly to the <em>souls</em> and <em>bodies</em> of men.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> <em>Christ Jesus</em> and his <em>Apostles</em> and <em>messengers</em> were
endued with <em>power</em> from on high, not only to preach the
<em>Word</em> for <em>conversion</em> but also with <em>power</em> of calling out
<em>Devils</em>, and healing bodily <em>diseases</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Holy women
great helps
in the Gospel
of <em>Christ Jesus</em></div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, as an <em>holy witnesse</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em> (a <em>Woman</em>)
once answered a Bishop, <em>I am a member of Christ Jesus</em> as
wel as <em>Peter</em> himselfe. The least <em>Believer</em> and <em>Follower</em>
of <em>Jesus</em> pertakes of the <em>nature</em> and <em>spirit</em> of him their
holy <em>head</em> and <em>husband</em>, as well as the <em>strongest</em> and <em>holiest</em>
that ever did or suffered for his holy <em>name</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore it is that we read not only of the <em>service</em> of
those great <em>master-builders</em> and <em>work-men</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>,
the <em>Apostles</em>, but also the <em>service</em> and helpe of <em>Christian</em>
women, for instance (<cite>Rom.16.</cite>) <em>Phebe</em>, <em>Priscilla</em>, <em>Mary</em>,
<em>Persis</em> were eminently noted for helping forward the
work of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, to wit, the glorifying of <em>God</em> in the
saving of the poor sons of men.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But is it not possible for <em>Gods</em> children to be
slack in this <em>work</em> and <em>trade</em> of doing good to the <em>souls</em> and
<em>bodies</em> of others, and yet be strong in <em>grace</em> and <em>healthfull</em>?</p>

<p><em>I answer</em>, Doubtlesse <em>Gods Children</em> may be <em>strong</em> one
way, and <em>weak</em> in another, <em>strong</em> in one <em>grace</em> and <em>weak</em>
in another, <em>strong</em> in one <em>tryal</em> and <em>weak</em> in another: But
it is their <em>weaknesse</em> and <em>sicknesse</em>, when they are slow and
negligent of so <em>glorious</em> and heavenly a <em>worke</em>.</p>

<p>Thus <em>Paul</em> complains of the Saints of <em>Asia</em>, that he
found none that stuck close to him but <em>Timothie</em>. Thus
was it in <em>Barucks weaknesse</em> and <em>sicknesse</em> to seek great and
earthly things, and <em>Jeremie</em> (strong in spirituall <em>health</em>
and <em>life</em>) chides and reproves him for it, <cite>Jer. 45</cite></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Secondly.</i></div>

<p>Secondly, It argues <em>strength</em> of spirituall <em>life</em>, when we
bear a strong <em>affection</em> to the <em>seed</em> of the <em>woman</em>, <em>Christs
seed, Gods children</em>. To doe good to all men is a <em>Christians
trade</em>, but especially to the <em>houshold</em> of <em>faith</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
cannot
but naturally
love one another.</div>

<p>This was <em>Davids affection</em> (<cite>Psalme 16.</cite>) when he look't
upon <em>Gods children</em> as the excellent of the <em>Earth</em>, and
placed all his <em>delight</em> in them: Thus <em>Jonathan</em> though he
lost his <em>Fathers love</em> for <em>Davids</em>, though he was to loose
a <em>Kingdom</em> by <em>David</em>, yet he loves him as his own <em>Soul</em>.</p>

<p>Thus <em>Ruth</em> so loved that holy woman <em>Naomi</em>, that although
she were growne poor, a widow, and now in a
tedious <em>travel</em> from <em>Moab</em> to <em>Israel</em>, and <em>Naomi</em> did also
intreat <em>her</em> and her <em>sister</em> to goe back, and <em>Orpah</em> her sister
was already returned to her kindred and her <em>Gods</em>, yet
such was the flame of her holy <em>affection</em>, that she intreats
<em>Naomi</em> not to intreat her: Intreat me not to leave
thee, for whether thou goest I will goe, where thou dyest
I will dye, and there will I be buried: thy <em>God</em> shall
be my <em>God</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worldly men
may in a kind
love Gods
people.</div>

<p><i>Object.</i> May not <em>wicked persons</em> favour, love, and respect
<em>Gods children</em>? Did not <em>Saul</em> greatly respect
<em>Samuel</em>; and for a while <em>Herod</em>, <em>John</em> the <em>Baptist</em>? Did
not <em>Michol</em> love King <em>David</em>, as well as did her brother
<em>Jonathan</em>? yea did not <em>David</em> finde wonderfull favour in
the eyes of a <em>Philistian Achaz</em>?</p>

<p><em>I answer</em>, The <em>nature</em> and the grounds of the love of
<em>naturall persons</em> to <em>Gods children</em> must be rightly distinguished:
<em>Gods children</em> themselves may and ought to love
each other, and others also, according to any <em>naturall</em>
and <em>civill Relation</em>; yet onely <em>Gods children</em> can love <em>Gods
children</em> for the <em>grace</em> and <em>spirit</em> of <em>God</em>, which they see
and finde in each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But Gods
children can
only love
each other
with a spirituall
love.</div>

<p>Thus as two <em>Candles</em> or <em>Torches</em> they spiritually close
and embrace each other with heavenly affection, being
of one common <em>heavenly nature</em> together. Thus <em>Countrey-men</em>
meeting in strange and forraign <em>nations</em> presently
know each other by their <em>language, &amp;c.</em></p>

<p>Thus <em>Brethren</em> rejoyce to finde each other in <em>strange</em>
places, and to know themselves the sons of one <em>Father</em>
and <em>Mother</em>.</p>

<p>Thus <em>Fellow-souldiers</em> which stick close each to other
in <em>life</em> and <em>death</em>, yea, although <em>routed</em>, <em>disordered</em> and <em>flying</em>,
if possible they can discerne and know each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
may possibly
be unkind
and cruel
each to other.</div>

<p><i>Object.</i> But did not holy <em>David</em> (who was a man strong
in <em>grace</em>) did not he lay <em>plots</em> for the <em>life</em> of an holy man,
noble and faithfull <em>Uriah</em>? Did not <em>Asah</em> that holy King
of <em>Judah</em>, practice false <em>Imprisoning</em>, in committing the
man of <em>God</em> to prison, and that onely for his <em>faithfulnesse</em>
in reproving him from <em>God</em>?</p>

<p><em>I answer</em>, This shews that both <em>David</em> and <em>Asah</em> at
this time were very sick, and <em>David</em> upon his <em>recovery</em>
laments his <em>weaknesse</em> and <em>wickednesse</em> and <em>Blood-guiltinesse</em>,
<cite>Psal. 51</cite>,</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods people
in case may
be sharp each
to other, so
was <em>David</em>
sharply reprov'd
by <em>Nathan</em>.</div>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But may not <em>Gods</em> children have just cause of
exercising <em>sharpnesse</em> each to others?</p>

<p>Yea doubtlesse, for <em>Paul</em> withstood even <em>Peter</em> himselfe
to his face, and the <em>Church</em> of <em>Corinth</em> must put away and
deliver the <em>incestuous</em> person to the Devill; though probably
yet deare, and a brother, according to that of <em>Paul</em>
to the <em>Thessalonians</em>, yet count him not as an <em>Enemie</em>, but
admonish him as a <em>Brother</em>.</p>

<p>In a way of <em>Justice</em>, in a way of <em>Physick</em>, the dearest
<em>friend</em> or <em>Brother</em> may exercise much <em>bitternesse</em>, though
with much <em>sweetnesse</em> of <em>temper</em>, and with much tender
melting and bemoaning of <em>affection</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One of the
blackest
transgressions
in the world
for</div>

<p>Thus in cases have we seen mounfull violence used, to
a <em>wife</em> or <em>brother</em> in some kind of <em>distempers</em> and <em>distractions</em>.</p>

<p>But when <em>Gods children</em> shall so far degenerate, as to
<em>pursue</em> the life of each other, though it be with desire to
cover a sin, and to keep <em>Gods name</em> from being dishonored
(as in <em>Davids</em> case) it is a <em>weaknesse</em>, it is a <em>sicknesse</em>,
which although it be not unto death, yet bringeth it
neer unto <em>Deaths door</em>,and made <em>David</em> cry out with <em>bitternesse</em>
of his soul, <em>Deliver me from blood-guiltinesse O my
God, and my tongue shall sing loud of thy righteousnesse</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thirdly.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">A compassionate
heart even
towards
enemies is a
Christian
heart.</div>

<p>A third tryal of spirituall <em>health</em> and <em>strength</em> is a <em>compassionate</em>
and <em>pitifull, melting-heart</em> over the <em>afflicted</em> or
<em>miserable</em>, yea, although our <em>enemies</em>, or <em>enemies</em> of their
owne <em>Salvation</em>.</p>

<p>Thus the Lord <em>Jesus</em> sighs for the <em>hardnesse</em> of the
<em>heart</em> of his <em>Enemies</em>: thus he <em>weeps</em> over <em>Jerusalem</em> that
was to kill him, and prayed for his <em>persecutors</em> and <em>enemies</em>.</p>

<p>Thus <em>Jeremy</em> powres forth his <em>Book</em> and <em>Rivers</em> of
<em>Lamentations</em> for <em>Jerusalem</em> of old, as <em>Christ</em> for the latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><cite>2 Tim. 2. 26.</cite></div>

<p>Thus <em>Gods</em> people are commanded to <em>weep</em> with them
that <em>weep</em>: And when any oppose themselves, wee ought
in <em>meeknesse</em> and <em>patience</em> to bear it, as knowing their wofull
and miserable <em>bondage</em> and <em>slavery</em> to <em>Sathan</em>: And
who knows whether it will please <em>God</em> in infinite mercy
and compassion to deliver them by vouchsafing <em>repentance</em>
in <em>Christ Jesus</em>, as he hath done to us?</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But may not <em>Gods</em> children exceed and over-grieve
for others?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods people
mourn for
others.</div>

<p>Yea doubtlesse, and therefore <em>God</em> chideth <em>Samuel</em> for
over-grieving for <em>Saul</em>, because <em>God</em> hath rejected him:
<em>Gods</em> children may as well exceed the bounds of <em>griefs</em>
as of <em>joy</em> and <em>anger</em>, and any kind of <em>Passion</em> or <em>affection</em>:
but it is ever safer to fall on the right hand of too much
<em>mercy</em> and <em>compassion</em>, then on the left of <em>Anger</em>, <em>Wrath</em>
and <em>Cruelty</em>.</p>

<p>Hence <em>David</em> weeps over <em>sinners</em> with <em>Rivers</em> of <em>Tears</em>,
because they kept not <em>Gods Law</em>. Hence we are commanded
to bear the <em>burthens</em> of others, and so fulfill
<em>Christs Law</em>. All sin is a <em>burthen</em>, but especially to <em>Gods
children</em>, whether they commit it out of a deceived <em>judgment</em>,
and <em>conscience</em>, or out of <em>passion</em>, and sudden <em>slight</em>
of <em>temptation</em>: Their <em>sins</em> therefore (especially if <em>superiours</em>,)
we must cover, and with shame, and sorrow go
backward like <em>Shem</em>, and <em>Japheth</em>, as grieving, and unwilling
to behold their <em>nakednes</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But we are commanded not to suffer <em>sin</em> upon
our <em>Brethren</em>, but reprove them?</p>

<p><em>I</em> answer, then is the <em>tongue</em> a fit <em>instrument</em> to reprove
others, when it is tuned by a grieved <em>heart</em>, that considers,
and ponders it self, as subject to <em>temptation</em>, and <em>sin</em>, as
others, except <em>mercy</em> make the difference, and deliver
from <em>temptation</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4thly.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Impartiall reproving
a
character of
Gods people.</div>

<p>Fourthly, it is a good evidence of <em>spirituall health</em>, respecting
others, when we endure not sin to lie upon
them, or rather them to lie in the pit of <em>sin</em>, but endeavour
to help them out by wise, and loving, and seasonable
<em>reproof</em>, and <em>exhortation</em>.</p>

<p>Hence <em>Job</em> endures not <em>sin</em> in the wife of his <em>Bozome</em>,
but chargeth her with <em>folly</em> for her impatient, &amp; impious
<em>counsell</em>: Hence <em>David</em> smites deeply his dearest <em>Michol</em>,
when she mocks at his holy zeal for the <em>Lord</em>, and his
<em>worship</em>.</p>

<p>Hence <em>Christ Jesus</em> sharply reproves his faithfull servant
and Apostle <em>Peter</em>, and that only for (seeming)
loving, and affectionate <em>councell</em>: Get thee behind me
<em>Satan</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bold reprovers
for sin.</div>

<p>Again, as true love, and zeal for <em>God</em>, (when strong)
spares not the dearest: so neither doth it balk, or shun
the <em>highest</em>. Thus deal <em>Gods Prophets</em>, even with <em>Kings</em>,
and <em>Princes</em>: Thus <em>Samuel</em> spares not <em>Saul</em>, nor <em>Nathan</em>
<em>David</em>, <em>Eliab</em> <em>Ahab</em>, nor <em>John Baptist</em> <em>Herod</em> and his
<em>Queen</em>, even for those most neer, and darling <em>sins</em>, which
were most <em>dangerous</em> to touch, and meddle with.</p>

<p><i>Qu</i>: How stands such bold, and sharp <em>language</em>, (as
some of the <em>Prophets</em> used) with humble <em>Duty</em>, <em>Fear</em>, and
<em>Reverence</em>, due unto <em>superiours</em>?</p>

<p>I answer, as true <em>affection</em> stands with plain, and sharp
reproof of <em>dearest</em>, so true <em>humility</em> in bold dealing on
<em>Gods</em> behalf, with the most <em>supream</em>, and highest.</p>

<p>Hence are <em>Gods</em> people also commanded not only to
reprove, but to separate in case of finall <em>obstinacy</em> in <em>sin</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> This course may seem to destroy humane <em>society</em>,
yea <em>nature</em>, and civillity out of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Godliness
makes civilitie
more beautifull.</div>

<p>I answer, it is true that <em>Godlines</em>, and <em>Christian affection</em>,
and <em>zeal</em> for <em>God</em> destroys corrupt <em>nature</em>, and <em>humanity</em>,
but otherwise <em>Godlines</em> sanctifieth, and directeth <em>nature</em>,
and <em>civility</em>, in the fear of <em>God</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5thly.</div>

<p>Fifthly, it argues <em>strength</em> of <em>spirituall life</em>, and <em>grace</em>,
when a <em>Soul</em> is able to withstand, resist, and repell such
<em>sins</em>, unto which the <em>opportunity</em> of <em>temptation</em> sollicites,
and invites us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Joseph</em> and <em>David</em>
admirable
for resisting of
temptations.</div>

<p>Hence holy <em>Joseph</em>, and <em>David</em>, are propounded to us
for heavenly <em>examples</em> of <em>power</em>, and strength of <em>grace</em>, in
resisting those most, two plausible <em>temptations</em> (to which
the wicked <em>nature</em> of man is so <em>prone</em>, and <em>subject</em>:) the
one of <em>lust</em> to <em>Women</em>, when strongly and often solicited
by his wanton Mistris: the other of <em>revenge</em> toward man,
when his bloody <em>persecutor Saul</em>, seemed by <em>God</em> himself
to be delivered, and brought into his hand.</p>

<p><em>Obj.</em> But <em>David</em> himself was conquer'd by <em>uncleannes</em>,
and <em>Asa</em> wreaks his <em>wrath</em>, upon the very <em>servant</em>, and
<em>Prophet</em> of the most <em>High</em>, and yet both <em>David</em>, and <em>Asa</em>
were thought to be <em>strong</em> in <em>grace</em>, and <em>power</em> of <em>Godlines</em>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fals of
Gods children
and to what
end.</div>

<p>I answer, <em>Gods champions</em> are sometimes strong, and
sometimes weak, <em>strong</em> in some things, <em>weak</em> in others,
and (as the strongest <em>bodies</em>) subject to spirituall <em>colds</em> and
<em>falls</em>, and <em>hurts</em>, which are most graciously recorded for
our <em>comfort</em> in our <em>falls</em>, as well as the holy <em>victories</em> of
the <em>Saints</em>, to make us <em>watchfull</em>, and <em>couragious</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Christian
bearing of reproof
a good
argument of
much of
Christ Jesus.</div>

<p>Sixtly, in matters concerning others, it is a good <em>argument</em>
of <em>strength</em>, of <em>grace</em>, when we can patiently, and
thankfully bear a <em>Reproof</em>, and <em>Admonition</em>, when we can
esteem a <em>Reproof</em> for our evill <em>words</em>, or <em>ways</em>, not as a
<em>blow</em> or <em>stroak</em> on the <em>Head</em>, but as a sweet, and precious
<em>Ointment</em> powred on us.</p>

<p>Hence the admirable <em>patience</em>, and <em>meeknes</em> of <em>Hanna</em>,
when <em>Eli zealously</em>, but <em>uncharitably</em> reproved her for
<em>Drunkennes</em>. Hence when <em>Christ Jesus</em> most sharply reproved
<em>Peter</em>, and afterward <em>Paul</em> dealt severely with him
about dissembling in the matter of <em>Communion</em>; We hear
not of the least <em>impatient</em>, or <em>bitter</em> word to either, yea
when he was unjustly charg'd, and that by <em>Saints</em> (<cite class="no-italics">Act. 11</cite>)
he patiently bears it, and returns a soft, and gentle <em>answer</em>,
which turned their murmuring <em>accusations</em> into joyfull
<em>satisfaction</em>, and <em>thanksgiving</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods people
may possibly
be angry at
reproofs.</div>

<p>But now the <em>scorner</em>, yea the godly being (weak)
reproved burst out in wrath. Thus not only <em>Ahab</em>
imprisons <em>Micaiah</em>, and <em>Herod</em>, <em>John the Baptist</em>, but <em>Asa</em>
also claps up fast the reproving Prophet, and the best of
<em>Gods children</em> are subject to such sad <em>distempers</em>, when
either a mistake of <em>judgment</em>, or a <em>pang</em> of <em>passion</em> sinfully
hinders the <em>receit</em> and <em>working</em> of the <em>Reproofs</em> of the <em>Almighty</em>,
which are wholsome heavenly <em>potions</em> intended by
him the <em>Father</em> of mercies, for our good, who ever be
the <em>cup</em>, the <em>vial</em>, or <em>instrument</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naturall wisdome
goes far,
but not so far
as spirituall.</div>

<p><i>Obj.</i> Many <em>Philosophers</em> by <em>naturall wisdome</em>, and many
<em>civill</em> and <em>morall</em> men, out of the <em>principles</em> of <em>civillity</em> and
<em>morality</em>, and sometimes for some private ends, will bear
a <em>Reproof</em> with <em>patience</em>: And hence that of <em>Solomon</em>, rebuke
a wise <em>man</em>, and he will love thee: whence it may
seem that men by strength of <em>wisdome</em> may receive in
<em>love</em>, and <em>profit</em> by a <em>Reprehension</em>.</p>

<p>I answer, <em>Gods children</em> (as well as naturall men) may
also act from <em>Rules</em> of <em>Reason</em>, and naturall wisedom, but
withall they act from an higher <em>ground</em>, and <em>principle</em>, that
is they hear they see <em>Gods wise</em>, and <em>holy</em> permitting hand
in the foulest <em>mouth</em>; So <em>David</em> acknowledgeth <em>God</em> in
<em>Shimeis</em> railing, and <em>Hezekiah</em> in <em>Rabsheka</em> his <em>provocations</em>,
and <em>blasphemies</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reproaches
send Gods
people unto
God.</div>

<p>2dly. <em>Gods children</em> by <em>reproofs</em>, by <em>slanders</em>, and <em>reproaches</em>,
are sent to <em>God</em>: So <em>David</em> as a figure of <em>Christ
Jesus</em>, and so <em>Moses</em> also, when the people in their <em>murmurings</em>,
reproached him, as the <em>cause</em> or <em>occasion</em> of their
<em>miseries</em>, he runs to <em>God</em>, and praies even for those <em>unworthy</em>,
and <em>unthankfull</em> men.</p>

<p>Lastly, with reference to our walking with others, it
is an <em>argument</em> of great strength of <em>grace</em>, when <em>glory</em>
of the <em>Lord</em> and the salvation of <em>Gods</em> people is so great,
and so <em>dear</em> in our eyes, that we can with (upon <em>supposition</em>
of them two) that we not onely loose our <em>temporall</em>,
but our eternall <em>state</em> and <em>welfare</em>: Hence those two
famous and <em>wonderfull speeches</em> of those two glorious stars
<em>Moses</em> and <em>Paul</em>: Blot me out of thy <em>book</em> saith <em>Moses</em>:
And I could wish to be accursed from <em>Christ</em>, saith <em>Paul</em>,
for <em>Israels</em> sake.</p>

<p><i>Ob.</i> But can such a <em>wish</em> be lawfull though for the <em>gain</em>
and <em>glory</em> of <em>Christ</em>, since to be accursed from <em>Christ</em> cannot
be without sin against <em>Christ</em>?</p>

<p>I answer: I will not dispute what <em>accursedness</em> or <em>separation</em>
from <em>Christ</em>, that is, some saying that <em>Paul</em> wished
onely a <em>temporall</em>, and some an <em>eternall separation</em> from
<em>Christ</em>: some a <em>separation</em> from <em>joy</em> and <em>delight</em> in the
<em>presence</em> of <em>Christ</em>, but not from the <em>puritie</em> and holiness
of <em>Christ</em>: But I say, doubtless so neer as any soul approacheth
to these heavenly <em>copies</em> of <em>Moses</em> and <em>Paul</em>, so
neer comes he to the greatest <em>strength</em>, and health, and
beautie of a <em>Christian</em> life.</p>

<p><i>Ob.</i> But can any man now attain to such a <em>strength</em> of
<em>grace</em> as this, so to wish?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different manifestations
of
Christ Jesus
in his people.</div>

<p>I answer: as it is in <em>nature</em> so in <em>grace</em>, there are <em>children</em>
and <em>young</em> men (or <em>strong</em> men,) and there are <em>old</em>
and <em>aged</em> men in <em>Christ</em>: Again, as it is <em>nature</em>, so in
<em>grace</em>; there are <em>differences</em> of <em>children</em>, and differences of
<em>young</em> and <em>aged</em> men in <em>Christ</em>: every <em>Israelite</em> had not
the strength of <em>Samson</em>: nor every of <em>Davids</em> Souldiers
the <em>strength</em> and <em>valour</em> of <em>Davids worthies</em>: yet so neer
to these heavenly <em>copies</em> as we approach, the <em>stronger</em> we
are in the <em>grace</em> of <em>God</em> in <em>Christ</em>: And doubtless it cannot
be but it is in the desire of every true <em>childe</em> of <em>God</em>,
not onely to enjoy a prettie moderate <em>health</em> of <em>spirituall</em>
life, but to be as <em>strong</em> in <em>faith</em> as <em>Abraham</em>, in meekness
as <em>Moses</em>, in <em>patience</em> as <em>Job</em>, in <em>affection</em> to <em>God</em> as
<em>David</em>, and as <em>zealous</em> for the <em>Lord</em> and his <em>glory</em>, as were
this blessed <em>pair</em> of <em>zealous</em> servants of the most high,
<em>Paul</em> and <em>Moses</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some means

<p class="drop-cap">I Am now come (dear Love) to the third and last

the preventing of <em>spirituall sicknesses</em> and <em>diseases</em>: In this I

<div class="sidenote">Soul-examination

means of spirituall

<p>First then, holy <em>consideration</em> of our <em>estate</em>, a deep and
frequent <em>examination</em> of our <em>spirituall</em> condition is an excellent
means of <em>Christian health</em> and temper: Thus
teacheth us the holy <em>Spirit</em> of <em>God</em> by <em>Jeremie</em>, <em>Lam: 2</em>.
<em>Let us search and try our ways, and turn unto the Lord.</em></p>

<p>This searching and examining of our ways in <em>Gods</em>
presence is (as it were) a casting up of our <em>accounts</em> between
<em>God</em> and our souls, wherein we truly verifie that
true saying, That often <em>reckoning</em> makes <em>God</em> and our
<em>souls</em> true <em>friends</em>.</p>

<p>This <em>dutie</em> is hard, and therefore we must often crie to
<em>God</em> with <em>David</em>, <cite class="no-italics">Psal. 139</cite>. Search me O <em>God</em>, and try
my <em>heart</em>, and see if there be any <em>wicked</em> way in me, and

<div class="sidenote">Affliction the

<p>This holy <em>practice</em> ought to be frequent, but then especially
when the hand, and <em>Rods</em> of the <em>Lord</em> are upon

and we are most like then to be as the ground, mollified
upon a <em>Thaw</em>, fit to be broken up, or like the ground
moistened with <em>storms</em>, and <em>showers</em> from Heaven, then
in some hopefull turn for the <em>Lords</em> most gracious <em>seed</em>,
and heavenly <em>planting</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2dly.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Christ Jesus

<p>Secondly, maintain an earnest longing, and endeavour
to enjoy <em>Christ Jesus</em>, who is our <em>souls</em> life in every holy
<em>Ordinance</em>, which he hath appointed. If it be possible
(with true <em>satisfaction</em> to our <em>consciences</em>, and <em>doubts</em> in
<em>Gods</em> presence) let us never rest from being planted into
the holy <em>society</em> of <em>Gods</em> children, gathered into the <em>order</em>
of <em>Christ Jesus</em>, according to his most holy <em>will</em> and <em>Testament</em>:
Remembering that <em>Christian health</em>, <em>grouth</em>, and
<em>flourishing</em>, are promised to the <em>Trees</em> planted in <em>Jehovahs</em>

and soul <em>meals</em>, and <em>Breasts</em> which he hath graciously
appointed for his <em>children</em>, of all <em>sorts</em>, and <em>ages</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prayer with
fasting a most
Christian and
mighty ordinance.</div>

<p>Especially be much in holy <em>prayer</em>, and <em>fasting</em> before
the <em>Lord</em>: this is an <em>Ordinance</em> of which neither <em>Pope</em> nor
<em>Devill</em> could ever deprive a <em>child</em> of <em>God</em>: If it be possible
practice this duty with others, however before the
<em>Lord</em> in secret: remembring how frequent the <em>children</em> of
<em>God</em> in holy <em>scripture</em> were in this <em>duty</em>. <em>Daniel</em> is an heavenly
<em>pattern</em>: and so is <em>David</em>, who wept and chastised
his soul with <em>fasting</em> although he was reproached for it,
<cite class="no-italics">Psal. 69</cite>.</p>

<p>Our holy <em>Bridegroom</em> the <em>Lord Jesus</em>, tels us that the
<em>Bridegroom</em> shall be taken away, and then his servants
fast: as if he had expressly named the times of the <em>Antichristian
bondage</em>, wherein the <em>followers</em> of <em>Jesus</em>, like the
blessed <em>Women</em>, (<cite>John the 20</cite>.) <em>weeping</em>, cry out, they
have taken away my <em>Lord</em>, and I know not where they
have laid him.</p>

<p>This holy <em>Ordinance</em> is of such admirable use among
the <em>Saints</em>, that even in the first, and purest times of
<em>Christianity</em>, we read of <em>Christian yoak fellows</em>, consenting
to a <em>separation</em> from each other, for a time that they may
give themselves to <em>prayer</em>, and <em>fasting</em>, <cite class="no-italics">1. Cor: 7</cite>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But some say <em>fasting</em> as it seems to be more
proper to the <em>Old Testament</em>, so seems it not so usefull
in the <em>New Covenant</em>, when more <em>spirituall</em> worship, and
<em>spirituall</em> joys seem more <em>suitable</em>, and <em>seasonable</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The excellent

and fasting.</div>

<p>I answer, all the former <em>Scriptures</em> declare it to be an
<em>Ordinance</em> of the <em>New Testament</em>, as well as a <em>prayer</em> itself:
And for the <em>use</em> of it, it is most admirable for the <em>separating</em>,
and <em>abstracting</em> of the <em>mind</em>, and <em>spirit</em>, from earthly
<em>occasions</em>, and <em>comforts</em>, for the devoting of the <em>soul</em> to
heavenly <em>consideration</em>, and <em>examination</em> of our wayes, for
the pouring forth of <em>prayers</em>, and <em>cries</em> to <em>God</em> in the
many great, and mighty <em>straights</em> which <em>Gods</em> people passe
through in this <em>vale</em> of <em>tears</em>, and <em>Lamentation</em>. And
indeed it is (as I may say) the taking of a <em>soul sweat</em>, or
<em>soul purge</em> for the avoiding and cleansing out our spirituall
<em>Humours</em>, and <em>corruptions</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3dly.</div>

<p><em>Gods</em> children as <em>travailers</em> on the Land, as <em>Passengers</em>
in a <em>ship</em>, must use this world, and all comforts of it,
with <em>dead</em>, and <em>weaned</em>, and <em>mortified affections</em>, as if they
used them not: If <em>Riches</em>, if <em>Children</em>, if <em>Cattel</em>, if <em>Friends</em>,
if whatsoever increase, let us watch that the <em>Heart</em> fly
not loose upon them: But as we use <em>salt</em> with raw and
fresh meats, let us use no worldly comfort without a savoury
<em>Remembrance</em>, that these worldly <em>Goods</em> and <em>comforts</em>
are the common portion of the men of this perishing
<em>world</em>, who must perish together with them. Let us
muse upon their <em>insufficiency</em> to content, and fill our
<em>Hearts</em>, upon their uncertain coming, and going with
<em>Eagles wings</em>: upon their <em>anxiety</em>, and perplexednes full
of <em>Thorns</em>, &amp; <em>vexations</em>: upon their <em>certainty</em> of departing,
how soon we know not. O let us therefor beg <em>grace</em>
from <em>Heaven</em>, that we may use earthly <em>comforts</em> as a <em>stool</em>
or <em>ladder</em> to help us upward to heavenly <em>comforts</em>, <em>profits</em>,
<em>pleasures</em>, which are only <em>true</em>, and <em>lasting</em>, even <em>eternall</em>
in <em>God</em> himself, when these <em>Heavens</em>, and <em>earth</em> are gone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The power of
meditating
the joyes that
are to come.</div>

<p>Fifthly, to maintain a spirituall <em>health</em> and <em>chearfulness</em>
is of no small use (as <em>Paul</em> writes to <em>Timothie</em>) sometimes
to help our <em>cold stomacks</em> with a little <em>wine</em> or <em>strong drink</em>
of the <em>hope</em> of the <em>joyes</em> to come: Lay hold (saith <em>Paul</em> to
<em>Timothie</em>) of <em>eternall life</em>: and as the <em>Souldier</em> meditates
upon the <em>glory</em> of his <em>victories</em>: The sick <em>passenger</em> at
Sea upon his <em>sweet refreshings</em> on shore: the <em>Traveller</em>
upon his <em>journeys end</em> and <em>comforts</em> at his home: the <em>Labourer</em>
and the <em>Hireling</em> on his <em>wages</em>, the <em>Husbandman</em> on
his <em>harvest</em>: the <em>Merchant</em> on his gain: the <em>woman</em> in
<em>travail</em>, on her <em>fruit</em>: so let us sometimes warm and revive
our cold <em>hearts</em> and fainting <em>spirits</em>, with the assured
hope of those <em>victories</em>, those <em>crowns</em>, those <em>harvests</em>, those
<em>refreshings</em> and <em>fruits</em>, which never <em>eye</em> hath seen, nor <em>ear</em>
hath heard, nor never entred into mans <em>heart</em> the things
which <em>God</em> hath prepared for them that love him: Of
which however it pleaseth <em>God</em> to give his servants a <em>taste</em>
in this <em>life</em>, yet the <em>harvest</em>, and the <em>vintage</em> are to come,
when they that suffer with <em>Christ Jesus</em> shall reign with
him, and they that have sown in <em>tears</em> shall reap the
never ending <em>harvest</em> of inconceivable joyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bitter and
untoothsome
things may
yet be of a
blessed and
wholsome use
to Gods people.</div>

<p>Sixthly, as it is in the <em>restoring</em> of the <em>body</em> to <em>health</em>,
or in the <em>preserving</em> of it in an healthfull <em>condition</em>: it is
often necessarie to use the help of <em>sharp</em> and <em>bitter</em> things,
<em>bitter pils</em>, <em>bitter potions</em>, <em>bitter medicines</em>, <em>sweatings</em>, <em>purgings</em>,
<em>vomitings</em>, <em>blood-lettings</em>, &amp;c. So is it with our <em>souls</em>,
and <em>spirits</em>, and preservation of the <em>health</em> and <em>chearfulness</em>
of the spirituall and the <em>inner</em> man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two sorts of
bitter afflictions.</div>

<p>The <em>sharp</em> and <em>bitter</em> things which it pleaseth <em>God</em> to
make use of in these cases are of two sorts.</p>

<p>First, such as himself is pleased to use towards us in
the <em>way</em> of his fatherly <em>afflictions</em> of all <em>sorts</em>: on our
<em>spirits</em>, our <em>bodies</em>, our <em>yoak-fellows</em>, <em>children</em>, <em>servants</em>, <em>cattel</em>,
<em>goods</em>, &amp;c. out of which, yea also out of the <em>injurious</em>,
and <em>slanderous</em>, and persecuting dealing of others, yea and
out of our own <em>sins</em> and failings his most holy and infinite
<em>wisdom</em>, fetcheth all sorts of <em>cleansing</em> and <em>purging</em>,
yea and sometimes a <em>cordiall</em> and healing <em>physick</em>.</p>

<p>The second sort of sharp and <em>bitter</em> means are such, as
we <em>voluntarily</em> use and <em>apply</em> our selves unto our selves,
for the <em>slaying</em> and the <em>purging</em> out of the <em>filthy humours</em>
and <em>corruptions</em> of <em>pride</em>, <em>securitie</em>, <em>uncleanness</em>, <em>self-love</em>,
<em>covetousness</em>, and what ever else remains behinde of the
<em>body</em> of <em>death</em> in us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scripture
the true
storehouse of
soul physick.</div>

<p>It is true that the <em>word</em> of <em>God</em>, and all his holy <em>Ordinances</em>,
they are not only of a <em>feeding</em>, and <em>nourishing</em>, but
also of a <em>purging</em>, and <em>cleansing Nature</em>, of a <em>preserving</em>,
and a <em>restoring Quality</em>: and therefore out of these, we
must take <em>direction</em> for all our <em>spirituall Remedies</em>, against
those <em>foul distempers</em>, unto which our <em>spirituall</em>, and <em>inner</em>
men are subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The remembrance
of our
sins bitter, yet
an wholsome
pill.</div>

<p>First, then it is an <em>wholsome</em> though <em>bitter pill</em>, often to
call to mind our <em>many</em>, our <em>great</em>, our <em>known</em>, our <em>unknown</em>
transgressions against; the <em>Lord</em> as a <em>Creatour</em>, against the
<em>Lord</em> as a <em>Father</em>, against the <em>Lord</em> as a <em>Redeemer</em>, against
<em>Christ Jesus</em>, against his holy <em>Spirit</em>, against his <em>Ordinances</em>,
against his <em>Saints</em>, against our <em>selves</em>, &amp;c. Yea the <em>sins</em> and
severall <em>corruptions</em> of our <em>Natures</em>, <em>callings</em>, and <em>conditions</em>,
to which we yet are subject, and lye open, and without
<em>supply</em> of <em>Grace</em>, and <em>strength</em> from <em>Heaven</em>, we shall fall,
and tumble into, as well as the strongest of <em>Gods servants</em>,
of whose wofull <em>falls</em> we read of in holy Scripture.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> It is a part of the <em>Lords New Covenant</em>, that he
will forgive our <em>sins</em>, and remember our <em>iniquities</em> no more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods children
bound to beg
for pardon of
sin.</div>

<p>I answer, unto all the <em>promises</em> of all sorts, (<cite class="no-italics">Ezek. 36</cite>.)
it pleaseth the <em>Lord</em> to adde this Gospel <em>Proviso</em>; For
all this I will be sought unto saith the <em>Lord</em>, according
to that most holy direction, of the <em>Lord Jesus</em>, to pray
daily, not only for <em>daily Bread</em>, but also for <em>daily forgivenes</em>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> The Lord hath forgiven them already in <em>Christ</em>,
what need to pray for forgivenesse of them again.</p>

<p><em>I answer</em>, We must marke the <em>Lords Ordinance</em>, for all
this I will be sought unto: <em>Prayer</em> and other <em>spirituall
Ordinances</em> hath the Lord appointed for our <em>souls</em> good,
as well as <em>corporall meanes</em> for our bodily comfort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Godly sorrow
not inconsistent
but subservient
to
spirituall joy.</div>

<p>Hence the many examples of the servants of <em>God</em>
throughout the whole Scripture, both before <em>Jesus Christ</em>
and since, <em>David</em>, <em>Peter</em>, <em>Mary Magdalen</em>, breaking forth
into heavenly showres of godly <em>teares</em>. Hence the
<em>Paschall Lambe</em>, (the figure of <em>Christ Jesus</em>) was appointed
by the <em>Lord</em> to be eaten with <em>bitter herbs</em>, implying
and teaching that <em>Jesus Christ</em> himselfe, his <em>blood</em>, <em>pardon</em>
of <em>sin</em>, <em>Life</em> and <em>Salvation</em>, and all the <em>spirituall</em> and <em>eternall
sweets</em> that here below we finde in <em>Christ Jesus</em>, they
have not their <em>native</em> and proper rellish without the helpe
of such sharp and bitter <em>hearbs</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods councels
absolve
not us from
menes &amp; endeavours.</div>

<p>What though therefore in <em>Gods councel</em> before the
<em>world</em> was, all his works of <em>creation</em> and <em>redemption</em>, <em>vocation</em>,
<em>justification</em>, <em>glorification</em> are knowne to him and acted
by him? I say, in the most inconceivable deep <em>councels</em>
of his will, according to which he worketh all things,
<cite>Ephes. 1. 11</cite>? yet were it <em>presumptuous madnesse</em> in us,
and a tempting of the <em>jealous eyes</em> of the most <em>High</em>, to
neglect the <em>wayes</em>, and <em>meanes</em>, and <em>paths</em> of <em>mercy</em> for
<em>Soul</em> or <em>Body</em>, which his most holy <em>Wisedome</em> out of <em>infinite
Grace</em> and <em>goodnesse</em> hath appointed to us?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The due consideration
of
Gods justice
is an heavenly
though bitter
pill.</div>

<p>A second sharp and bitter <em>pill</em> to purge out spirituall
<em>corruption</em>, is a due and serious pondering of the <em>nature</em>,
of the <em>justice</em> of the most <em>High</em>; notwithstanding all the
infinite <em>sweetnesse</em> of the <em>Ocean</em> of his <em>mercy</em>, and notwithstanding
all the <em>colours</em> and <em>pretences</em> which we poor sinners
invent to our selves, to hide from our eyes, the
<em>greatnesse</em> and <em>dreadfulnesse</em> and terrours of it.</p>

<p>Well therefore might <em>Job</em> say: therefore am I troubled
at his presence, and when I consider I am afraid of him;
and <em>David</em>, <cite>Psal. 119</cite>. My <em>Flesh</em> trembleth for fear of
thee, and I am afraid of thy <em>judgements</em>.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But <em>John</em> saith, perfect <em>love</em> casteth out <em>fear</em>.</p>

<p><em>I answer</em>, The true love of <em>God</em>, never casteth out the
true feare of <em>God</em>, but only that which is false and <em>counterfeit</em>,
that which is the fear of a <em>Beast</em> of <em>slaves</em> and
<em>Devils</em>.</p>

<p>Hence it is that the <em>Spirit</em> of the fear of the <em>Lord</em> was
poured upon the <em>Lord Jesus</em> himself.</p>

<p>This <em>feare</em> is an holy <em>awe</em> or <em>reverence</em> proper to a
true and heavenly ingenuous child of <em>God</em>, even (first
and chiefly) to <em>Christ Jesus</em>, the <em>elder Brother</em> (in a sence)
of all the <em>children</em> of <em>God</em>. To cherish which holy <em>fear</em>
of <em>God</em>, let us cast our eyes upon the fiery flashes of his
severe <em>justice</em> revealed unto us in a three-fold time, the
time <em>past</em>, <em>present</em>, and to <em>come</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dreadfull
rejection
of the Angels</div>

<p>For the time past, how dreadfull is that we finde of
the <em>rejection</em> and <em>ejection</em> of so many glorious heavenly
Spirits the <em>Angels</em>, tumbled down for their sin of <em>Pride</em>,
from the heighth of <em>Heaven</em>, and their glorious attendance
upon <em>God</em>, to the depth of <em>Hell</em> in horrible <em>slavery</em>
to everlasting sinnes and torments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dreadfull

all mankind.</div>

<p>How dreadfull was that dolefull <em>Sentence</em> upon the
whole race of <em>mankinde</em>, for the Sin of the first <em>root</em>, our
first <em>Parents</em> in <em>Paradice</em>? How wonderfull those <em>Plagues</em>
and <em>Destructions</em> upon <em>Pharaoh</em> and the land of <em>gypt</em>,
for their oppressing Gods people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The destruction
of <em>Egypt</em>
and <em>Sodom</em>, &amp;
the whole
world.</div>

<p>And (before that) how fearfull and horrible was that
<em>destruction</em> and <em>burning</em> up of <em>Sodom</em>, and <em>Gomorrah</em> and
other <em>Cities</em> with <em>fire</em> and <em>brimstone</em> from Heaven?</p>

<p>And (before both these) how wonderfully fearefull and
universall was, the <em>destruction</em> of the whole <em>world</em>, in
that choaking, and All-o'erwhelming <em>flood</em> or <em>deluge</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fearfull
stroaks of
Gods justice
upon <em>Israel</em>.</div>

<p>How fearfull were the stroaks of <em>Gods</em> displeasure
upon his owne people of <em>Israel</em>, in their many <em>Destructions</em>
and <em>Captivities</em>? How fearfull the rejection of the
ten <em>Tribes</em> wholly swallowed up and lost for so many <em>ages</em>
and <em>generations</em>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Upon the
<em>Jews</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>.</div>

<p>How lamentable were the <em>destructions</em> (and especiall
that by <em>Titus</em> and <em>Vespasion</em>) of the holy <em>City</em>, that glorious
<em>Jerusalem</em>, in the slaughter and captivity of 1100000
thousand <em>Jewes</em>, <em>men</em>, <em>women</em> and <em>children</em>?</p>

<p>How fearfull was the rejection of that whole <em>Nation</em>
of the <em>Jewes</em>, ever since but a <em>curse</em> and a <em>scorne</em> to all the
rest of the <em>Nations</em> of the world to this day?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Upon the Son
of his love the
<em>Lord Jesus</em>.</div>

<p>And (above all) who can but tremble at the <em>impartiall
flames</em> of <em>Gods justice</em> on that <em>green</em> and <em>innocent</em> tree, his
owne, and only begotten son <em>Christ Jesus</em>, when he stood
surety in the room of <em>sinners</em> to make <em>satisfaction</em> for their
<em>transgressions</em>?</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Grant <em>Gods justice</em> and <em>fierce wrath</em> to be so hot,
so fiery and fearfull towards his <em>enemies</em>, yet, what need
his <em>children</em> fear his <em>justice</em>, since that it is satisfied and
his wrath appeased towards his people, by the <em>sufferings</em>
and <em>blood-shed</em> of <em>Christ Jesus</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The heavy &amp;
dolefull
stroaks of
Gods righteous
hand upon
his own people
in this
world.</div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, It is so evident, that although <em>Christ Jesus</em>
his blood, hath quenched the fire of <em>Gods eternal wrath</em>
toward his people, and sweetened the bitter <em>Cup</em> of all
present <em>Judgements</em> and <em>afflictions</em>: yet for his <em>Name</em> and
<em>Justice</em> sake in this world, <em>Gods children</em> have temporally
felt the fearfull stroks of his displeasure, and judgment
must begin at the house of <em>God</em>.</p>

<p>Hence that dreadfull <em>blow</em> of <em>Gods</em> righteous <em>hand</em>
upon our first <em>Parents Adam</em> and <em>Eve</em>, cast out of <em>Paradice</em>
with their <em>posterity</em> (even the whole race of <em>mankind</em>) notwithstanding
their belief in the <em>promised seed of Christ Jesus</em>.</p>

<p>Hence the heavy <em>stroakes</em> upon <em>Lot</em>, upon <em>Lots wife</em>,
upon <em>Moses</em>, upon <em>Aaron</em>, upon <em>Sampson</em>, upon <em>Eli</em>, upon
<em>David</em>, upon <em>Hezekiah</em>, upon <em>Josiah</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But some may say, <em>God</em> sees no sin in <em>Jacob</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods holy end
in his sore afflictions
upon
his people.</div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, Their calamities are Judgements, that is
righteous sentences of the most high, <em>Judgements</em>, though
not eternall Judgements: these vindicate <em>Gods</em> name and
<em>Justice</em> before an unrighteous <em>world</em>, and beare him witnesse
of his <em>impartiality</em>, even towards his owne <em>children</em>;
these humble and bring his people to repentance and
confession, and quicken their pace, and their hearts, to
watch against future <em>sins</em> and <em>provocations</em>.</p>

<p>Hence saith the <em>Spirit</em> of <em>God</em> expresly, <cite>1. Cor. 11</cite>.
For this <em>cause</em> (that is for his childrens abuse of the <em>Lords
Supper</em>) many are <em>weak</em> and <em>sick</em>, and some are falne <em>asleep</em>;
<em>God</em> chastiseth his own people, true <em>christian Churches</em>,
for the abuse of his holy <em>Ordinances</em> and <em>appointments</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods justice
visibly seen in
the present
sorrows of all
sorts.</div>

<p>In the second place, let us cast our eyes abroad and
behold the direfull signs and tokens, of <em>Gods</em> severe
Justice executed at this present in the <em>world</em>. How lamentably
doe we see before our eyes the daily and continued
effects of that first <em>wrath</em> upon mankind, in so
many <em>sorrows</em> of all sorts for the first transgression.</p>

<p>Let us consider of the great constant <em>reproach</em> and
misery over all the <em>Nations</em> of the <em>World</em>, by reason of
<em>Gods</em> righteous <em>Sentence</em> in the division of so many <em>Tongues</em>
and <em>Languages</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The horrible
desolations
of late years.</div>

<p>O come and see (saith <em>David</em>) what <em>Desolations</em> (<cite>Psal.
46.</cite>) the <em>Lord</em> hath wrought in the <em>Earth</em>? How many
<em>hundred thousands</em> of <em>men</em>, <em>women</em> and <em>children</em> have of late
years been swept away in the <em>world</em>, by <em>wars</em>, <em>famines</em> and
<em>pestilences</em>?</p>

<p>And since we are commanded to <em>weep</em> with them that
<em>weep</em>; O that our <em>heads</em> were <em>fountains</em>, and our <em>eyes
rivers</em> of <em>waters</em>, that wee might weep with <em>Germany</em>,
weep with <em>Ireland</em>, yea, weep day and night with <em>England</em>
and <em>Scotland</em> (to speake nothing of other remote <em>Nations</em>)
in laying againe and again to <em>heart</em> the stroakes of <em>Gods</em>

<div class="sidenote">The wonderfull

<div class="sidenote">The direfull

<p>The effects and marks of these most dreadfull <em>blowes</em>,
every <em>eye</em> is forced to see but yet there are some <em>stroakes</em>,
more fearfull and yet not easily perceived; such are the
righteous <em>judgements</em> of <em>God</em>, giving up the <em>Nations</em> of
the <em>world</em> to so many horrible and blasphemous <em>worships</em>,
<em>idolatries</em> and <em>superstitions</em>. To speak nothing of whole

the <em>mouth</em> of that wonderfull <em>grave</em> of <em>unbeliefe</em>, wherein

<div class="sidenote">The direfull

<p>Who can but <em>wonder</em> and <em>tremble</em> at so many hundreth

the world) I say, given up to those two monstrously bewitching
<em>Worships</em> of <em>Mahumatisme</em> and <em>Antichristianisme</em>,
the dire effects of <em>Gods</em> most righteous judgements upon

<div class="sidenote">The lamentable

<p>Adde to these that most fearfull and deplorable <em>captivity</em>
of the very <em>soules</em> and <em>consciences</em> of <em>Gods</em> owne people
(for so many hundred years) under false and superstitious
<em>Worships</em>. A righteous <em>judgement</em>, though not
so easily discerned, yet in it selfe most dreadfull, and
exceeding all the temporall calamities in the <em>world</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dreadfull
and eternall

yet to come.</div>

<p>But (thirdly) from these two times of <em>past</em> and <em>present</em>,
let us cast our eyes on the third which is yet to come,
as <em>sure</em> and <em>wonderfull</em>, will shortly be these two most
wonderfull and dreadfull <em>downfals</em> of those two so mighty
<em>Monarchies</em> (so great enemies to <em>Christ Jesus</em>) the <em>Turkish</em>
and the <em>Popish</em>: according to the Prediction of the holy
<em>Prophets</em>. How fearfull the <em>effusion</em> of the <em>Viols</em>, in part
fulfilled, and yet to be powred forth in their season?
And not a little wonderfull is that mighty <em>destruction</em> of
the <em>Nations Gog</em> and <em>Magog</em> gathered as the <em>sand</em> of the
Sea against the camp of the <em>saints</em> of the holy <em>City</em>.</p>

<p>And (to come to the full <em>period</em> and <em>finall sentence</em> of
the most righteous <em>Judge</em> of the whole <em>world</em>) with what
<em>horrours</em> and <em>terrours</em> shall these <em>Heavens</em> and <em>Earth</em> passe
away; this <em>Earth</em> with the works thereof being consumed
and burnt up? How inconceivably direfull will the last
<em>eternall judgement</em> be, when two worlds of men (the former
destroyed by <em>water</em>, and this by <em>fire</em>) shall appeare,
before the most glorious <em>Tribunall</em> of the Son of <em>God</em>?
When all the most <em>secret sins</em> shall be brought to <em>tryal</em>,
and an account shall be given for <em>every idle word</em>?</p>

<p>O who who can conceive the <em>terrours</em> of that thundering
<em>sentence</em> [<em>Goe yee cursed into everlasting fire, prepared
for the Devill and his Angels, where the worm never dyes,
and the fire never goes out</em>.]</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But some may say, Can these sayings be any
other then a <em>Parable</em> or <em>similitude</em>? for is the <em>Devill</em> capable
of any <em>materiall fire</em>? such as now is grievous and
painfull to <em>flesh</em> and <em>blood</em>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Parables
of holy Scripture
are ful of
heavenly kernels
of Truth.</div>

<p><em>I answer</em>, Grant these sayings <em>Parabolicall</em> or <em>similitudes</em>,
as also that of <em>Dives</em> and <em>Lazarus</em>: yet what are <em>Parables</em>
and <em>similitudes</em> but <em>Glasses</em> to represent unto us
in more plain and easie wayes the holy <em>truth</em> and mind
of <em>God</em>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The worme
that never

<p>The <em>Kernell</em> of <em>truth</em> is not the lesse sweet though
wrapt up in the <em>shels</em> and <em>husks</em>; Beyond all question
therefore <em>Christ Jesus</em> foretels most sure and inconceiveable
plagues to all that know not <em>God</em>, and obey not his
glorious <em>Gospel</em>: And by this <em>Worme</em> that never dyes,
and this <em>fire</em> that never goes out, declares a <em>torment</em> to be
inflicted upon both <em>men</em> and <em>devils</em> which shall be extream
like fire which shall be universall upon the whole
sinfull <em>creature</em>, no part exempted, which shall be also
<em>eternall</em>, never dying, never ending, yet we may adore
<em>Gods</em> righteous judgements and (working out <em>Salvation</em>
with fear and trembling) make sure of a <em>Jesus</em> a <em>Saviour</em>
to deliver us from the <em>wrath</em> that is to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The meditation
of death.</div>

<p>In the next place (my deare Love) let us downe together
by the <em>steps</em> of holy <em>meditation</em> into the <em>valley</em> of the
shadow of <em>Death</em>. It is of excellent use to walke often
into <em>Golgotha</em>, and to view the rotten <em>skuls</em> of so many
innumerable thousands of millions of millions of men
and women, like our selves, gone, gone forever from
this life and being (as if they never had <em>life</em> nor being)
as the swift Ships, as the <em>Weavers shuttle</em>, as an <em>arrow</em>,
as the <em>lightning</em> through the aire, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is not unprofitable to remember the faces of such
whom we knew, with whom we had sweet acquaintance,
sweet society, with whom we have familiarly eaten and
lodged, but now growne <em>loathsome</em>, <em>ugly</em>, <em>terrible</em>, even to
their dearest, since they fell into the <em>jawes</em> of <em>death</em>, the
<em>King</em> of <em>terrors</em>.</p>

<p>And yet they are but gone before us, in the <em>path</em> all
<em>flesh</em> must tread: How then should we make sure, and
infinitely much of a <em>Saviour</em>, who delivers us from the
<em>power</em>, and <em>bitternesse</em> of <em>Death</em>, and <em>Grave</em>, and <em>Hell</em>, who
is a <em>resurrection</em> and <em>life</em> unto us, and will raise up and
make our bodies glorious, like his glorious <em>Body</em>, when
he shall shortly appear in glory.</p>

<p>It is further of great and sweet use against the <em>bitternesse</em>
of <em>Death</em>, and against the <em>bitter-sweet delusions</em> of this
world daily to thinke each day our <em>last</em>, the day of our
<em>last farewell</em>, the day of the splitting of this <em>vessell</em>, the
breaking of this <em>buble</em>, the quenching of this <em>Candle</em>, and
of our passage into the land of <em>Darknesse</em>, never more to
behold a sparke of <em>light</em> untill the Heavens be no more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3 Terrible

<div class="sidenote">Meditations

as to

<p>Those three uncertainties of that most certain <em>blow</em>, to
wit, of the <em>Time</em> when, the <em>Place</em> where, the <em>Manner</em> how
it shall come upon us, and dash our <em>Earthern Pitcher</em> all
to pieces, I say the consideration of these three, should
be a threefold <em>cord</em> to bind us fast to an holy <em>watchfulness</em>
for our <em>departures</em>, and a <em>spur</em> to quicken us to aboundant
<em>faithfulnesse</em> in <em>doing</em> and <em>suffering</em> for the <em>Lord</em> and his
<em>Christ</em>, it should draw up our minds unto <em>heavenly objects</em>,
and loosen us from the vexing <em>vanities</em> of this vaine
<em>puffe</em> of this present sinfull life.</p>

<p>Oh how weaned, how sober, how temperate, how mortified
should our <em>spirits</em>, our <em>affections</em>, our <em>desires</em> be,
when we remember that we are but strangers, converse
with <em>strange companies</em>, dwel in strange houses, lodge in
strange beds and know not whether this day, this night
shall be our finall change of this strange place for one

<p>How contented should we be with any <em>Pittance</em>, any <em>Allowance</em>

<p>How thankfull unto <em>God</em>, unto <em>man</em> should we poor

unto us, when we remember we are but strangers in an

long <em>Summer</em> dayes, yet our very life and being is but a
swift short <em>passage</em> from the bank of <em>time</em> to the other side
or <em>Banck</em> of a dolefull <em>eternity</em>?</p>

<p>How patient should our <em>minds</em> and <em>bodies</em> be under the
<em>crossing</em>, disappointing hand of our all-powerfull <em>Maker</em>,
of our most gracious <em>Father</em>, when we remember that
this is the short <em>span</em> of our <em>purging</em> and <em>fitting</em> for an eternall
<em>Glory</em>, and that when we are <em>judged we</em> are <em>chastened</em> of
the <em>Lord</em>, that we should not be <em>condemned</em> with the world?</p>

<p>How quietly (without the <em>swellings</em> of <em>revenge</em> and
<em>wrath</em>) should we bear the daily <em>injuries</em>, <em>reproaches</em>, <em>persecutings</em>,
&amp;c. from the hands of men, who passe away
and wither (it may be before night) like <em>grasse</em>, or as the
<em>smoake</em> on the chimnies top, and their <em>love</em> and <em>hatred</em>
shall quickly perish?</p>

<p>Yea, how <em>busie</em>, how <em>diligent</em>, how <em>solicitous</em> should we
be (like <em>strangers</em> upon a strange <em>Coast</em>) waiting for a
<em>winde</em> or <em>passage</em>) to get <em>dispatched</em> what we have to doe
before wee hear that finall call, <em>Away, Away</em>, let us be
gone from hence, &amp;c.</p>

<p>How should we ply to get <em>aboard</em> that which will
passe, and turne to blessed <em>account</em> in our own <em>countrey</em>?</p>

<p>How should we over-look and despise this <em>worlds
trash</em> which (as the holy <em>woman</em> going to be burnt for
<em>Christ</em> said of money) will not passe in Heaven?</p>

<p>How zealous for the true <em>God</em>, the true <em>Christ</em>, his
<em>praise</em>, his <em>truth</em>, his <em>worship</em>, how faithfull in an humble
witnesse against the <em>lyes</em> and cozening delusions of the
<em>Father of lyes</em>, though guilded o're with <em>truth</em>, and that
<em>by</em> the hands of the highest or holyest upon the Earth?</p>

<p>How frequent, how constant (like <em>Christ Jesus</em> our
<em>Founder</em> and <em>Example</em>) in doing good (especially to the
<em>Souls</em>) of all men, especially to the <em>Household</em> of <em>Faith</em>,
yea even to our enemies, when we remember that this
is our <em>seed time</em>, of which every minute is precious, and
that as our <em>sowing</em> is, must be our eternall <em>Harvest</em>: for
so sayeth the Spirit by <em>Paul</em> to the <em>Galathians</em>: <em>He that
soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption</em> or <em>rottennesse,
and he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit
reap life everlasting</em>.</p>

<p>Obvious printer's errors were corrected.</p>

<p>Every effort has been made to replicate this text faithfully, including obsolete and variant spellings, inconsistent and non-standard punctuation,
inconsistently hyphenated words, and other inconsistencies.</p>

<p>There are several places where opening or closing parentheses marks appear, and it is not clear from the text where the paired parenthesis would appear.
In each case, the single parenthesis was left in place and no opening or closing parenthesis added.</p>

<p>However, where printing issues interfere with readability, and the intent is absolutely clear from the text, changes were made to the transcribed text.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
